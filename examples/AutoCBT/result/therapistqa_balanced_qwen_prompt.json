        "question": "From a teen in Australia: This story is incredibly long but I’m going to do my best to cut it down and only include the most important bits. When I was 14 and in a very low place, I met a teacher at my school. She was around 30. I didn’t think much of it at first, but eventually I kept talking to her more and more and seeing her around. We grew close quickly and for some reason I just felt connected to her. One day I received a text message from her as she had gotten my number off another student.",

            "Thank you for writing. You did nothing wrong! You did not put this woman in prison. She did it to herself. She befriended, manipulated and abused a vulnerable 14-year-old (actually, two young teens). She is a sexual offender who was grooming you, not loving you. She belongs in jail.This was never an equal or appropriate relationship. As a teacher, she used her position of authority and the fact you were needy and looked up to her as means to draw you in. She was so good at gaslighting you that you believed and still believe that her abuse was love. She did all the classic moves of an abuser: She gained control of you by making you think you were special. She isolated you, making you more and more dependent on her. She created a relationship where you were always on eggshells, trying not to say or do anything that would cause a fight. She created fights anyway and then made you feel like you were at fault. Apologies and presents followed — which only confused you more. Any time that you questioned her or the relationship, she blamed and shamed you. While demanding total loyalty to her, she was disloyal to you.Don’t blame yourself! You are thinking and feeling and acting like many survivors of abuse. You are still confused. You are still taking blame on yourself. Your abuser may be in prison, but she is still in your head.I don’t know why you stopped seeing a psychologist. You do need help to sort this out. An experienced therapist will not judge you. Your feelings are recognizable for what they are — a reaction to prolonged abuse. Sadly, your experience is not unique or as complex as you believe it is. We therapists often, too often, see something like it.Please. Make an appointment with a licensed mental health counselor who specializes in trauma. You have recovery work to do. You deserve to free yourself of the blame and shame so that you can find real love in a real relationship.I wish you well. "

        "cbt_answer": "Thank you for sharing this, and I understand that sometimes emotions can be overwhelming. It sounds like your connection with this teacher may have been a source of comfort during a difficult time. Let's take it step by step using CBT principles.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nI appreciate that you're trying to keep it brief, and I'm here to listen and understand your feelings. It's not uncommon for people to form close bonds with authority figures, especially during adolescence when relationships can be impactful.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nThe key thought or belief in this situation might be that you developed strong feelings for your teacher, and there could be concerns about the appropriateness of the relationship due to the age difference. You might also feel guilty or worried about how others might perceive it.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you tell me more about how you felt when you received the text message? Did you believe it was a sign of something inappropriate, or did you hope for a deeper connection? Also, consider if there were any red flags or warning signs from your teacher's behavior that you didn't initially notice?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nIt's essential to consider the potential consequences and boundaries. Was there a clear understanding from both of you about the nature of your relationship? If you're still struggling with these feelings, talking to a trusted adult, like a parent or counselor, might help you process it. It's also crucial to respect and remember that teachers have a professional responsibility, and relationships with students can blur the lines.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, it's okay to have mixed feelings and to prioritize your well-being. If you decide to address this, it could be a learning opportunity to navigate relationships and set boundaries. If not, focusing on the positive aspects of the connection and seeking support to move forward can be beneficial.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss further or if you need some guidance on how to approach this situation.",

            "At 63, you are still working on this. For that I give you enormous credit. Thank you for writing.I ask you to consider this: It’s likely that you did not have the impact on the therapist that you thought you did. She moved on to a new job. You are the one who cancelled appointments and didn’t give the two of you the opportunity to terminate well.In my opinion, it is possible that you skew new information to fit your idea of yourself. This is called “assimilation”. Assimilation is when people fit new information into their existing ideas of themselves and the world.Such beliefs are called “schemas” by theorist Jean Piaget. Everyone has such schemas. It is how we categorize and process new information. If we didn’t have them, we would be overwhelmed by every new thing we see, learn, and experience. Schemas give us something to go on as we try to understand new facts, opinions, and ideas. It is so much easier to modify new information to fit our existing beliefs than to change our beliefs, whether those beliefs are positive or negative.You have an idea of yourself as someone other people will ultimately abandon. I’m guessing you are so sensitive to that possibility, that you see abandonment when people need to leave you (like your therapist), regardless of the reality.  Fearing abandonment, just waiting for the “other shoe to drop”, you provoke the very abandonment you fear or interpret something someone says or does as further evidence that you are a person that other people leave.One of the ways you preserve some self-esteem is to see yourself as powerful; as having permanent impact on others’ ability to trust. That may be true in some cases, but it is unlikely that you have that much impact on others, especially on an experienced therapist.I suggest you get back into therapy. Take your letter and this response, whether or not you agree with me, to the first appointment. It will give the new therapist an immediate understanding of where to begin.You haven’t yet given up on yourself. Don’t start now. Make that appointment. You could live for another 30 years, decades without this burden.I wish you well."

It's important to acknowledge your feelings and the impact of失信 on your therapeutic relationship. Let's explore this together using the structure of CBT.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nI can imagine how challenging it must be to confront the situation and the potential guilt you're feeling. It's okay to take time for yourself and process these emotions. Remember, it's natural to feel hurt and betrayed after such a significant trust has been broken.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nYour thought here seems to be that by lying and canceling the final appointments, you were trying to test your therapist's commitment or push her away. This belief might be causing distress and contributing to the sense of betrayal. It's crucial to recognize that your intentions might not have been fully realized, and consequences can often be unpredictable.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you reconsider why you felt the need to lie in the first place? Was it a fear of vulnerability or a misunderstanding about how to handle the change? Have you thought about how your actions might have affected your therapist's perception without knowing her true intentions?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nInstead of pushing away, you might want to apologize and communicate openly with your therapist. Explain your reasoning, but also acknowledge the harm caused. It might be helpful to send a heartfelt message expressing your regret and asking if there's a way to make amends, even if it's through a different form of support or a professional consultation.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, change and loss in therapy can be a turning point for growth and finding a new therapist. It's a learning opportunity. Take some time to reflect on what you want from your next therapeutic experience and how you can create a more honest and trusting relationship.\n\nRemember, therapy is a two-way street, and it's essential to be open and honest with your therapist. If you're unsure about finding a new therapist, consider reaching out to your therapist's recommendations, your insurance network, or seeking support from professional associations.

For the past 7 months I’ve been under extreme mounts of stress followed by a few panic attacks, that have left me so emotionally unstable that I feel that I’m teetering on edges of insanity. I’m in constant fear that I might be experience psychosis. I’ve been having hypnagogic hallucinations right before falling asleep that have left me in so much distress. Sometimes I’ll hear a loud sound or different voices that are loud. I’d like to not that I’ve experienced this for most of my life. But since having these panic attacks and just hours on the internet and reading about mental illness it has left me scared that it maybe something more. I’m extremely scared I might be in the beginning stages of schizophrenia. I’ve become hyperaware, I literally am always making sure that I’m not hearing things or seeing things. I just feel so lost and sad all the time I just want to feel whole again. Sorry if this seems a little jumpy I’m just in tears as I type this. I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety or any anxiety disorder and I fear it may be more than that anyway. I’ve become so afraid of my mind because if I have a weird thought I am constantly ruminating on it and it drives me up the wall. Couple of days ago I literally typed in the same question about schizophrenia 30 different times. I need help but I’m so afraid that the Doctor may confirm my fears. I just don’t know what to do. Is the hyperawareness of sounds, weird thoughts and hypnagogic hallucinations a sign that I’m becoming schizophrenic?

            "It’s impossible to give a diagnosis over the internet. The most common questions that I receive here at Psych Central are from people with anxiety disorders who fear that they may be developing schizophrenia. Anecdotally, it seems to be a very common fear, especially among people with anxiety.It makes sense that people with severe anxiety would believe that they might have schizophrenia. People with anxiety disorders often fear the worst-case scenario. In their minds, schizophrenia is the worst-case scenario. Among the lay public, it is the most frightening of all mental health disorders.Panic attacks are frightening. Panic attacks cause an extreme state of heightened distress. As you mentioned, it makes you feel like you’re on the “edges of insanity.” That’s how all people feel when they are experiencing panic attacks. Panic attacks are a sign of an anxiety disorder, not a psychotic disorder. Even though it may feel that way, it is not that way.The idea that you have yet to consult a mental health professional is likely contributing to this problem. I understand that you’re frightened of treatment but you have nothing to fear. Mental health professionals want to help you. Good, effective treatment is available.Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders in the world. Highly effective treatments exist that can help you immediately, relieving your distressing symptoms. When you think about it, it’s nonsensical to suffer with a highly treatable condition. The sooner that you seek treatment, the sooner you will feel better.Nothing that you have written in your letter would indicate schizophrenia. You mentioned hypnagogic hallucinations before falling asleep. Those are a normal part of falling asleep but we often only remember them when we are having trouble falling asleep. If we have them, then immediately wake up, we remember them. If we have them and then fall asleep, we don’t remember them at all.If I could interview you, I would want to know why you are experiencing so much stress. What is causing you to feel this way? Stress has a cause. You are obviously worried about something. Did something recently change in your life? What are you worried about? It’s important to know what is causing these problems.Even if it’s difficult, make it a priority to consult a mental health professional. Once you have the initial meeting, you will likely quickly begin to feel better. You will see that it is not a frightening experience. Treatment can begin as soon as the first session. That means that you will likely leave your first session with less anxiety and a solid treatment plan for the future. You will be on your way to recovery.One of the best ways to reduce anxiety is to focus on reality. Staying grounded in reality is an important element in reducing panic and fear. Obviously, that is easier said than done which is why it’s important to consult a mental health professional. They will know how to help you. They have received explicit training to help with these types of problems. You should not wait another day. Make an appointment immediately. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care."

It's totally okay to feel overwhelmed, and I'm here to listen and support you. It's important to know that one person's experience doesn't dictate their entire future, and many people go through similar challenges.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nYour key belief seems to be that your current symptoms (hyperawareness, hypnagogic hallucinations, and frequent ruminations) might be a sign of schizophrenia. This belief is based on the fear of a diagnosis and the potential联想 to your family history. It's important to remember that individual experiences vary, and just because you're experiencing these things doesn't automatically mean you have schizophrenia.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nLet's consider this: Are these symptoms consistent with what you've learned about schizophrenia from reliable sources, or are they more like temporary stress-related changes? Have you spoken to a mental health professional before, and if not, what might prevent you from seeking help? Also, it's important to remember that many people experience anxiety without developing schizophrenia.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nIt might be helpful to start by talking to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or a psychiatrist. They can evaluate your symptoms and provide a professional diagnosis. It's important to keep an open mind and remember that seeking help is a sign of courage, not weakness. They can guide you through the diagnostic process and help you develop coping strategies to manage your anxiety.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, a diagnosis is just a label, and it doesn't determine your entire reality. It's possible that your symptoms are related to your stress or anxiety, which can be effectively treated. Keep in mind that recovery takes time, and there are many resources available to support you. Don't hesitate to reach out for help, and don't let fear keep you from taking that first step.\n\nIn conclusion, it's important to address your concerns with a professional, but it's also crucial to remember that your thoughts and feelings are valid. You are not alone, and there is hope for managing and overcoming your anxiety.

            "Congratulations on bringing your new baby into the world. Since you are in your 30s and you are concerned with attachment issues, I’m guessing that this was an all the more special event in your life.First, please take a look at the research on attachment outcomes for babies who are in daycare. They generally do as well or better than babies who are not. Babies in childcare do know who their mothers are. By six months, babies are secure in their attachment to their moms, especially when the moms do as you are doing while they are on leave — spending a lot of time and having a lot of contact with their children.What you can do to ease both of you into your eventual return to work is to gradually start spending some time apart. You may already be doing this. Put your baby down in a baby carrier or a comfortable made-for-baby cushion for short times during the day. Give him some experience with you putting him down and then coming back. Allow your friends to hold him and play with him at times so he gets used to interacting with other people besides you. Since you are breast feeding, start doing some pumping (and stock piling milk in the freezer) and introduce a bottle for a feeding or two when he is six months old to get him used to it. Talk to your pediatrician or a lactation specialist about how best to do this.It will be hard at first to leave him. You are part of an attachment couple after all. But do remind yourself that providing for him financially as well as emotionally is part of what will keep him safe and secure. If your work is part of what makes happy, he will also have a happier mom. To keep the emotional attachment going, all you need to do is establish a relaxed and attentive routine as you get ready in the morning, play with him between when you get home and bedtime, and enjoy your weekends together.I wish you well.

CBT can help us navigate this situation. Let's start by validating your feelings and empathy for the situation:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy: It's natural to worry about the changes, but you're doing your best to provide a strong foundation for your baby. You've already established a routine with breastfeeding, co-sleeping, and using a carrier. That's a great start.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief: One potential concern could be that you think being away for part of the day will cause significant disruption and harm to attachment. This belief might be based on the fear of losing ground you've made so far.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection: While it's true that some distance will introduce a new dynamic, research suggests that a consistent presence and supportive routine are crucial, rather than constant physical presence. Consider these points: you can maintain a consistent feeding schedule, even if it's not during work hours, and you can continue to use the carrier for brief periods to provide comfort.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: To make things easier, you could:\n- Prioritize and plan your work schedule to minimize the need for long absences when he's awake and awake modes, and use your work-from-home time for those moments.\n- Establish clear routines and transitions for when you're not around, like dropping him off and picking him up at the same time or with a familiar caregiver.\n- Communicate with your partner, if possible, to share the responsibility of childcare and ensure consistency.\n- Keep in touch through video calls or apps to maintain a sense of connection.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight: Remember that you're doing the best you can, and it's okay to ask for help or support from family, friends, or professional child care. Be patient with yourself and your baby during this adjustment period. With these strategies in place, you can help maintain a strong bond despite the distance.\n\nRemember, it's not about being perfect, but about being present and responsive when you're together.

            "It’s not clear what you mean by “submission to authority” or “arbitrary authority.” I wish that I had more details about the circumstances of your firings and decisions to quit. It could be that the people in “authority” are bosses (or managers). These individuals always have more power than employees. Their job is to oversee and manage those employees. The hierarchy is such that the boss naturally has more power than do the individuals working under them. They are in a position of telling others what to do. These are, of course, general statements about the power dynamics between bosses and their employees and certainly would not apply to everyone, in every situation.The boss also provides guidance and leadership to employees. Many have earned their place in the company. They often acquired their higher-level status after having worked many years with the company. Employees, especially new employees, look to them for advice. Employees often haven’t been at the company as long as the boss and thus rely on their advice.Sometimes, people can be resentful of the boss. This is especially true when the boss is unfair, bullies their employees or creates a toxic work environment. It’s not clear if any of those situations where applicable to you or if you simply resent being told what to do, under any circumstances.If you cannot work because of this issue, then you have a dilemma. You will have severely limited your job prospects. That significantly narrows the scope of options you have for work or a career. This hurts your ability to make a living. It is you who will suffer from your inability to work with others. You have the potential to lose out on great jobs and a satisfying career. You also face a significant loss of potential income. One needs to work in order to have money to pay bills, to eat, to have a home, and so forth. You need money to live.In addition, if you live in the United States, you need to have health insurance. Without health insurance, you face serious financial and medical consequences. Those without health insurance often forgo preventative care and risk not being able to pay their medical bills, should they get sick and need treatment. Medical care can be extraordinarily expensive. Recent studies indicate that the majority of bankruptcies in the United States are linked to medical issues. Often, health insurance comes from the employer and without this benefit, many simply cannot afford health insurance.People can also gain satisfaction and a feeling of accomplishment from their jobs. This is not to say that a person’s self worth should be tied to their careers or what they do for a living but it can positively affect their confidence levels. Competence increases one’s self-esteem. Without those occupational elements in your life, you may suffer from a lack of competence, confidence and or self-esteem.If you can’t function in the traditional work environment, then you’ll need to find another way to make a living. One potential option is to be your own boss. Perhaps you can start your own business. That’s one potential workaround.You mentioned that you have BPD but I’m not certain if you meant borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder. In any event, one strategy for attempting to resolve this problem is counseling. You might consider it to adjust or realign your mindset around these issues. Your inability to be deferential to authority hurts your job prospects and thus potentially your ability to have a happy and well-adjusted life. If you are open to it, counseling could remedy this.

For example, have you tried communicating your boundaries assertively or seeking support from HR or a therapist to learn coping mechanisms?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nOne strategy could be to focus on finding a job with a more flexible or understanding employer who values open communication and supports employee well-being. You might also consider looking into remote work options or jobs in industries with less hierarchical structures. Additionally, you could work on improving your assertiveness and conflict resolution skills through therapy or training.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember that healing takes time and it's okay to take things at your own pace. While it may be challenging to find work immediately, continuing to practice your coping skills and seeking support can eventually lead to a more stable situation. Don't be too hard on yourself if progress is slow, and remember that you're doing the best you can.\n\nI hope this helps in guiding your thought process and decision making. Remember to be kind to yourself and seek professional support as needed.",

            "It sounds like moving back in with your parents was a bad idea. These are not your problems. Your father told you about your mother, and now he’s expecting you to keep it to yourself. There’s no need to pretend that everything is fine. If you didn’t live there anymore, this would no longer be your problem. This is not to say that you would ignore it and act like nothing is happening but these are their problems to work through. It’s their marriage.As for your mother no longer acting like a mother, you and your siblings are adults (from what is sounds like in your letter). The job of a parent is to prepare their children for the world, so they can make it on their own. That job usually ends around the age of 18, and then parents need to make the transition to advisor and friend. You moved out and were doing fine but decided to move back in. Your mother had moved on with her life and was doing things that interested her. The way she figured it, her job was done.Understandably, it’s difficult to be in the middle of this type of situation. Your father should have kept that level of personal information to himself. It would have been better if he could have gone to a therapist to discuss those issues. It’s the ideal place to be dealing with matters of infidelity and other relationship issues. You might suggest that he talk to a therapist about these personal issues instead of you. Therapists are trained to know how to deal with these issues.If you’re struggling with these issues, you might also consider consulting a therapist. It might help while you are living with your parents. It might also help you to clarify what you want to do with your own life. At 25, people are exploring what it is they want to do. They are thinking about their careers, developing their own relationships, and getting to know who it is they are and what they want to be. These are the developmental tasks that are necessary for healthy psychological growth and development. These are the kinds of things that should be the primary focus of your life at this time. Let your parents deal with their own marriage and relationship. They are going to have to figure out these things on their own.I’m sorry you’re dealing with this problem. It’s not easy to be in the middle of these sorts of issues. Love and support your parents. Offer your moral support, but its best to try to focus on your own life. Good luck and please take care."

(I never hang around outside on corners) I begged him not to shoot me because I had two babies right up the road. He still shot me in my head it felt so real.. I seen the flash from the gun, I felt the hot bullet; go through left side of my head, (right behind my hair line) and i also felt the the bullet come out of the my right side of my neck/underneath the chin.  I could also feel the warm sticky blood coming from my head and neck.

            "Thank you for writing. I’m sure this did scare you! Some dreams are like epic dramas. They feel so very, very real.There are dozens of books about dreams that suggest concrete meaning for various images that occur in people’s dreams. They make for interesting reading but they aren’t helpful. Why? For the simple reason that different images have different meaning depending on a person’s culture, life experience, and current situation. In white middle American culture, for example, the color white generally means innocence or purity. But in China it can symbolize misfortune or mourning. A blank computer screen for one person might symbolize a fresh start or endless possibilities. For another person, it could mean blank despair.As an American, you are currently being inundated by news stories of mass shootings, including the shooting of children. My guess is that it is making you more anxious than you realize. You may be able to bury your anxiety during the day when the busyness of taking care of your own children is distracting. But when you are asleep, the censor that operates during the day shuts down. All that anxiety gets funneled into the “what ifs” that you put in the back of your mind during the day.What your dream is telling you is that you are frightened, which to me means that you are paying attention. Shootings are happening in malls, in churches, at concerts. Sandy Hook, where twenty 6-year-olds were gunned down in school, reverberates in every mother’s subconscious. Where are our children safe? Where are we safe? How do we protect our kids and ourselves without living in constant fear?I think your image of sitting on the bench with snacks was your attempt to answer the question. You were trying to keep things ordinary when tragedy was happening. I think the fact that your children were “up the road” was your way to tell yourself that maybe you could keep them safe even if you and their father were shot.In short: Your dream makes perfect sense to me. It wasn’t just a horror story. It was a visual presentation (as all dreams are) of your fears and hopes.I wish you well."

It's common for our dreams to be symbolic or reflect our subconscious thoughts and emotions. Let's explore this together using CBT:\n\n1.

Dreams often play out our worries and fears, so it's important to acknowledge those feelings and remember that this is a normal part of our sleep process.\n\n2.

You might also feel responsible for your boyfriend or children's safety, which could be influencing the dream.\n\n3.

What might be driving the fear or violence in the dream?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: To cope with these feelings, you can try talking to your partner or a trusted friend about your concerns. Practicing relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, can help manage stress. It might also be helpful to discuss the dream with a therapist who specializes in dream analysis or CBT, where we can explore these symbols further.\n\n5.

Your stepdaughter says that you are jealous. It looks to me like she may be projecting her jealousy on you.You are only 10 years older than she is so it’s not possible for her to think of you as an additional mother in her life. To her, you are a competitor for her daddy’s affection, attention, and even money. I’m guessing that she has strong feelings about the divorce and, consciously or unconsciously, wants to undermine your marriage. Apparently, she and her mother agree about this, which complicates things even more. The daughter is acting as her mother’s spy in a divorce that doesn’t look like it’s over — at least for her mother.Your husband is caught between his love for you and his desire to be loved by the daughter he loves.

I don’t really talk to myself, I talk to people I no longer know and people I wish to know. I engage in long conversations with them that may last for 1~3 hour/s. I talk and imagine their answers in my head and then reply. I’ve been okay with it but for the past year, it started to bother me because I realized I waste about 30% of my day on it. I low-key like it, because it gives me chances I was never given and probably will never be given. I imagine myself doing all the stuff I couldn’t do. I started to feel really bad about it when I realized I don’t fully move on from any single thing in my life (a past lover or something I failed in before) because of this. I basically never forget anything that happened to me because I keep repeating everything in my head and also make up scenarios that never happened. It’s starting to get out of control because it makes me unable to focus, whenever I see a movie I keep pausing to talk for some time and then I go on with the movie and repeat, which ends up with me finishing a 2 hour movie in over 5 hours. I never felt bad about it but now I do because I came to know that’s basically why I never move on. I repeatedly think about things that happened years ago. I’ve had OCD since I was in grade 5 (about 8 years ago), I never fully recovered from it, it comes and goes. I don’t know if it might be related. I tried controlling myself and refusing any urges to talk to whoever I talk to but I always fail. Thing is, I fully understand I’m not talking to real human being and I’m merely pleasing myself by achieving stuff I couldn’t in real life, so I don’t think I’m crazy or something. I just need to know if it’s serious, and I certainly need help on how to stop this because I need the time I waste on doing it. (From Egypt)",

            "Thank you for sharing this difficult concern with us. You’ve said that you’ve wrestled with OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) since you were a child. It seems to me that since this diagnosis has already been made it would be a very good idea to follow up with treatment. The repetitive and intrusive imaginary discussions seem right at the core of an OCD style behavior.A way to understand what is happening is that obsessive thoughts and behaviors can take many forms. Most of the compulsions are behaviors that can be observed, like washing hands or cleaning or arranging rituals. But some of the rituals may be mental. My best guess is that what you’ve explained sounds like a type of ritualized behavior. Keep in mind that I could be off on this because this isn’t a situation where I could diagnose someone — but the fact that you’ve been diagnosed with OCD and these patterns of thought follow a particular repetition and arrangement with your situation, makes me think having a discussion with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist is the best thing.For diagnosis and treatment the first thing is to make sure it is an OCD symptom and this can only be done with a trained professional.

Validation and Empathy:\nIt's clear that you've been engaging in this self-talk pattern for a long time, and it's started to feel like a burden. You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's understandable that you've found it comforting, even if it's taking up a significant portion of your day.

However, the distorted thinking is that this self-talk is a substitute for real human interaction and that it's preventing you from fully moving on. The OCD might also contribute to this by making it difficult to resist these urges.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you challenge this belief? Ask yourself, is your self-talk truly helping you let go or is it just keeping you stuck in the past? If you've been talking to these \"people\" for years and still haven't fully resolved past issues, might it be time to explore healthier coping mechanisms?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nFirst, try to identify triggers that ignite your self-talk. When you notice these, engage in mindfulness techniques or relaxation exercises to redirect your focus. You might also benefit from journaling to process your thoughts and emotions. For the OCD, consider seeking professional help from a therapist experienced in OCD treatment, like exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember that change won't happen overnight. Be patient and kind to yourself. Start small by setting a goal to limit the time you spend talking to yourself, and gradually increase that. Seek support from friends, family, or a therapist, as they can provide encouragement and accountability.

It is an attempt to protect itself — but whatever protects also inhibits. The nature of reactions from trauma center around the brain trying to remind and warn or avoid and forget what has happened. The limitations you are feeling sound like they are a direct result of all the loss and trauma you’ve experienced. While it isn’t something I could diagnose from your email there are conditions that can arise from this kind of ordeal that can have a debilitating effect. One of these can cause numbness and feelings of being detached, isolated or disconnected from other people or yourself. This symptom collection can be triggered by any number of events, but is known to occur as a result of sexual violence, profound loss or death, injury — or witnessing of these things. When something that can overwhelm us happens that includes these type of experiences it is classified as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.)

Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend.\n\n2. **Identify Key Thought or Belief**: You might be believing that you can't feel emotions again or that you need to protect yourself from further pain. This belief might be causing the barrier you mentioned. Challenge this thought by asking yourself: Is it true that you'll never feel again, or is it a belief that stopped you from processing your emotions?\n\n3. **Pose Challenge or Reflection**: Instead of thinking you can't feel, try reflecting on past experiences when you did feel emotions, even if it was a short while. Ask yourself, \"What if it's possible to feel again, and how can I slowly start to open up?\"\n\n4. **Provide Strategy or Insight**: Start small by practicing mindfulness or deep breathing exercises. These can help you become more aware of your emotions without necessarily feeling them fully. Also, consider seeking professional help, such as therapy, to work through the emotional blocks with a trained therapist who can guide you through the process.\n\n5. **Encouragement and Foresight**: Remember that healing takes time, and it's okay to take it at your own pace. Be patient and gentle with yourself. Don't be afraid to ask for support from friends, family, or a therapist. You'll likely need ongoing support as you work on rebuilding emotional trust and connection.\n\nRemember, healing is a journey, and it's okay if it takes longer than you'd like.

            "The research on whether or not cannabis causes schizophrenia is mixed. Scientists debate about causality. Generally speaking, individuals who use marijuana have a greater risk of having psychotic episodes than individuals who do not smoke marijuana. Psychosis involves a break with reality. Having a psychotic episode does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop schizophrenia, but it significantly increases the chances.Some research also indicates that each psychotic break damages the brain. That may be why it can take more medication to stabilize an individual after each psychotic break. You want to do everything in your power to avoid having psychotic breaks. That means not using drugs.The added concern about marijuana is its high potency levels. There’s a difference between the old and new cannabis. Levels of THC are much higher in the marijuana that’s available today than in years past. The higher the potency, the greater the potential for damage and detrimental outcomes.In addition to high potency levels, street drugs are dangerous, in part, because there are no checks and balances on ingredients. For instance, in an effort to expand their supply, dealers might add dangerous and toxic cutting agents such as rat poison, detergent, fentanyl, and so forth. With street drugs, there is no quality control. You simply don’t know what you’re getting.It’s safer not to use marijuana, especially given your family history. Having a family history of schizophrenia increases the probability of developing schizophrenia among offspring but it does not guarantee the development of the disorder.Schizophrenia is a complex disorder that is not well understood. Genetics are a factor and so is environment and other social and neurobiological considerations. Some research has indicated that if your parent has a serious mental illness, the risk of developing a serious mental illness among offspring is about one in 10. Newer research has indicated that the chances of developing serious mental illness among offspring is as much as one in three or one in two, of developing any mental disorder. Thus, if the disorder runs in your family, it’s important to be especially protective of your mental health. Therefore, you should strongly reconsider your use of illicit drugs.You had a negative experience and you seemed to recover. As you said, it only lasted two or three hours. You are fortunate. I have received letters from individuals who have used marijuana and who did not recover as quickly as you did. Some had symptoms that remained with them in the form of anxiety, depersonalization and derealization. Thankfully that didn’t happen to you.This may seem rather obvious but it needs to be said: you should stop using marijuana. Make that your last time. It would be wise to quit while you are ahead. The more you use it, the greater the risk of brain damage. It’s dangerous to use illicit drugs, of any kind. Stay safe and please take care."

        "cbt_answer": "Dear [User],\n\nI understand that you're experiencing a range of emotions following your second marijuana use, and it's understandable to feel concerned about the information you've come across. Let's approach this in a step-by-step way using CBT techniques:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nI can see how this experience might be scary and worrying, and I'm here to support you. It's completely normal to have questions and concerns given your family history. Remember, one isolated event doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop schizophrenia.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nYour core belief is that smoking weed after a family history of schizophrenia increases the risk and leads to auditory hallucinations. This thought is based on a single, potentially unusual experience and the fear of a possible link.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nWhile family history can be a risk factor, it's important to understand that not everyone with a genetic predisposition will develop schizophrenia. The symptoms you experienced after weed use could be a result of a variety of factors, including the amount smoked, individual sensitivity, and the unique circumstances.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nInstead of focusing solely on the fear, consider talking to a mental health professional, like a psychologist or psychiatrist. They can help assess your current risk and guide you through any necessary evaluation. Sharing your concerns with a trained professional can provide a more accurate understanding and appropriate guidance for managing this situation.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, one-time experiences, even if they're concerning, don't predict future outcomes. It's important to avoid making assumptions and make informed decisions about your future behaviors. If you decide to continue using drugs, consider doing so under controlled conditions and under the guidance of a medical professional.\n\nRemember, seeking help is a positive step, and it's crucial to approach your concerns with an open mind and a willingness to learn more. If you need to, I can connect you with resources in your area.\n\nTake care and stay hopeful.",

        "question": "From a teen in the Philippines:  I don’t take Social Isolation for 3 years as a serious problem. But everyone around me begs to differ. By ‘everyone” I meant my mother, as my father works overseas. But nonetheless, I found myself curiously fascinated by my lack of concern for my health, social and physical. It’s not because I don’t care for any of those, but rather the prospect of doing so seem bothersome. Maybe “not caring” and “not bothering” are the same sentences in different context. And maybe it is. I just find the word “not caring” a bit strong, as I do care to some degree, just don’t care “enough” which is one way you can put it.",

            "You didn’t waste my time. But you did certainly take the long way around to ask your question. So — yes, social isolation does affect a person — as it already has affected you. How do you deal with it? You already started by writing your letter to us here at PsychCentral.I do have to wonder: How are you managing to support yourself living as you do? Either you are independently wealthy or someone is enabling you. If the latter is the case, you are not as socially isolated as you think. It looks to me like your mother hasn’t given up on you if you continue to have a roof over your head and something to eat — or not eat. My guess is that your parents don’t know what to do but hope and hope that you will snap out of this if they just climb into your discouragement with you and leave you alone. That approach avoids fights but it does leave you alone and lonely.For that reason, I see this as a family case. You need help out of your depressed rut. Your family needs help finding a way to love you and help you without enabling your depression and dependency.At 18, it’s time for you to get going on adult life. My guess is that you are paralyzed by fear of what that entails. When people are afraid they generally respond with a fight, flight, or freeze reaction. In your case, you are fleeing by freezing. You have allowed yourself to think that if you do nothing, you can’t make a mistake. In some ways it works but the strategy has turned on itself. Now, not doing anything is the mistake. It’s taken on a life of its own. You are depressed and your life is depressing.You need help facing your fears. You need support to rejoin the social world and to become the fully functioning adult you can be. That means dealing with your sleep disorder. That means engaging in your hobbies for real. (There are millions of kids who enjoy LARPing in the woods and then hanging out. You could be enjoying their company.) That means taking steps to become independent – which means dealing with your social anxiety and either going to school or going to work (or both). None of this is news to you. But maybe I can give you an idea or two about how to approach it:Your self-esteem will not improve if you hide in your bedroom. It will improve if you start being a contributing member of your family.  If you wait until you feel good to do anything, chances are you will remain stuck.  Feeling good comes from doing things that are worthwhile. A place to start would be to set your alarm for the morning, get up and take a shower, then do something, anything, that is life-affirming, even something as mundane but important as doing your laundry. You can build from there.Your family needs help to stop feeling so helpless to help you. They need new tools to support you in dealing with your depression instead of leaving you alone. You didn’t choose to share your relationship with your father. If it is a good one, he may be at a distance but he can still be helpful, both to you and to your mother, through video calls and emails. He just may need some guidance about how best to help.It’s a tall order for anyone — and any family — to make such a significant change. That’s why I think it’s a team effort. You and your family need the support and practical help that a mental health professional can provide. I hope you will talk to your mother about finding a licensed family therapist to get the advice and support you all need and deserve.If it has become too hard to talk to her directly, please show this letter to your mother. I suspect she is discouraged and scared. Maybe hearing what I have to say will give her some direction in how to help both of you.I wish you well. "

            "Incest involves sexual relationships between people who are related by blood. According to the laws in your state (and the laws in virtually every other state and most countries), incest is illegal. You’re committing a criminal act. It is a serious crime that is punishable by law.Your state forbids marriage and sexual relationships between people who are closely related by blood. When the two of you were younger, and depending upon your age difference, your older brother could have been charged with the crime of unlawful intercourse with a minor. Had he been found guilty, he would have been deemed a sex offender, possibly sent to prison and potentially put on a sex offender registry that would have significantly limited his freedom.In order to be successfully prosecuted for incest in the state in which you live, three elements would need to be present: 1) that you had sexual intercourse with a close blood relative; 2) that you knew about the blood relation at the time of the sexual act; and 3) the sex was consensual. Based on everything you’ve written in your letter, it’s possible that you could be prosecuted for your behavior.In terms of punishment, it could range from spending 16 months to two or three years in prison depending upon your prior criminal record, whether both parties were consenting adults, the degree of the blood relationship, and other mitigating factors. Because incest is considered a sex offense, if found guilty, you would have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life.The reason incest is outlawed is because of the serious birth defects that could result from inbreeding. In studies of children of incest, nearly half were born with severe birth defects, suffered early death or experienced mild mental impairments. That children are at a high risk of experiencing those types of problems is one reason why incestuous relationships are so morally indefensible.You said that you can’t stop engaging in this sexual behavior but it’s important to recognize that you are making a choice. No one is forcing you to have sex with your brother. You are consenting to this behavior. You are an equal participant. You are choosing to continue to engage in a sexual relationship with your brother for personal reasons. The idea that you have no choice in this matter is simply untrue. You have a choice.The good news is that you have control over your behavior. You can choose to not engage in this illegal act. Should you get caught, not only would you be facing potential incarceration, but you also risk being labeled a sex offender and being placed on a sex offender registry for the rest of your life. That outcome would be immensely detrimental to your life.To admit that you want to stop but can’t indicates that this problem may not be something you can resolve on your own. I highly recommend that you consult a therapist. A therapist will not judge you or turn you in to the authorities. You will not shock them. They will simply help you to resolve this problem. It is better to deal with this issue now, rather than continuing to risk getting into legal trouble or producing a child that has a nearly 50 percent chance of living a compromised life. Good luck and please take care."

It's natural to feel overwhelmed and confused by these experiences.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nOne core belief seems to be that having sex with your brother is a way to secure his love and make him专属. This unhealthy thinking might be fueled by past experiences and the belief that you're unable to find fulfillment elsewhere. The jealousy towards other guys suggests a fear of losing your connection with him.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you question this belief? Is there evidence that you need to be with your brother for love or intimacy? Have you considered the possibility of healthy, separate relationships with other people?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nTo stop this pattern, you could start by setting boundaries and communicating your needs clearly. Discuss your feelings with your brother, explaining that you value your relationship but need personal空间 and respect in the bedroom. It's important to focus on building a healthy understanding of consent and individual relationships.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nIt might be helpful to seek professional help, such as therapy, to unpack these emotions and learn healthier coping mechanisms. Therapy can help you develop healthier relationships and a better understanding of your own desires and needs.

Let's work through this together using the principles of CBT.\n\nFirstly, I want to validate your feelings. It's understandable that you regret your actions, especially when they stem from a moment of intense emotions. It's crucial to recognize that impulsive behavior during difficult times can occur.\n\nNow, let's identify the key thought or belief. It seems you might be blaming yourself heavily for the keying incident, and perhaps there's a belief that you're a \"nasty person\" due to this one moment. This belief might be impacting your self-esteem and your ability to cope with the situation.\n\nTo challenge this, ask yourself: Is there evidence that you're always like that when under stress? Have you had similar outbursts in the past? Or is this a one-time exception? Remember, it's not fair to define yourself by one incident.\n\nNext, let's develop a strategy. In the future, when faced with strong emotions, it might be helpful to have a plan to manage them, like taking a moment to breathe or seeking support from a trusted friend. It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend about how you felt during that time.\n\nRegarding the car damage, you've already taken steps by apologizing and compensating. Those actions show integrity and a willingness to rectify the situation. Moving forward, continue to show her and yourself that this was an anomaly, not a reflection of your character.\n\nLastly, it's essential to remember that change takes time. Don't beat yourself up about it; focus on learning and growing from this experience. If you're still struggling, seeking therapy or counseling can be a valuable support.\n\nRemember, you've taken responsibility, and that's a big step. Keep working on understanding and managing your emotions, and you'll be able to overcome this challenge. If you need additional support, don't hesitate to reach out.",

So I did research starting from there. I’ve then realized that I lack empathy, guilt, remorse, compassion, you name it. However, I feel empathy for animals, not for humans. This is what’s making me confused. Once I’ve hurt someone, mostly emotionally, I wouldn’t feel guilty, even after my feelings for them have returned (after calming down). I’ve also realized that I’m very manipulative and dominant, I hate it whenever I feel like I’m not in control. I become more aggressive. And once something doesn’t go my way, I play as the victim or I try to make the person feel guilty or pity me so that they can give in. I don’t lie often, mostly because I don’t feel the need to since I don’t do bad things, I don’t mind following the rules as I think that they’re fair and don’t interfere with my life. I do lie sometimes, whenever I need to, I always get away with it. I also have superficial charm, it’s much easier to do online, I’ve noticed that people would fall for me in a matter of days to even a few hours. I don’t think that I am very narcissistic because I do have insecurities but sometimes I would feel like I am better than others, but that kind of feeling disappears quickly. I’ve been told that I can be cruel at times, I do admit that I am, especially towards people I dislike. I also feel satisfaction in seeing them hurt.

Perhaps understanding more about each of these will be helpful.First is to understand that psychopath and sociopath are pop psychology terms that are manifestations of an antisocial personality disorder, which means that they share the common traits of disregarding others rights and safety while being deceptive and manipulative. In spite of how these personalities are portrayed in Hollywood, neither is necessarily violent.The main instrument for diagnosing people with antisocial personality disorder comes from The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM-5), which defines antisocial personality as an individual with 3 or more of the following traits:To determine if your behaviors match this criteria here is a brief quiz that is not meant to diagnose but help you understand more about these concerns.The place to look for understanding the origin of an antisocial personality disorder is in childhood. The pattern of behavior often begins with four different categories classified as conduct disorders and include: People with these symptoms are at greater risk for antisocial personality disorder.The best way to find out more is to talk to a professional. A clinical psychologist can conduct a series of tests along with an interview to help determine what your symptoms mean. Since you list your age as 16 I’d recommend asking your parents to help set up a meeting.Finally, your email and asking these questions is an important element, perhaps, the most important, in understanding your true character.

As it is, having had only one session, I think the two of you may simply not be a match. You see, the most important factor in the success of therapy is whether the therapist and client feel there is a connection. If you feel you can trust and confide in the therapist and the therapist feels that she or he can help, then it’s likely that your therapy will move forward successfully.In your case, you are reporting that you don’t feel that your therapist has the skills to deal with your issues. You even feel that you overwhelmed him. It’s possible that you should have interviews with a few therapists and then choose the person you feel gets you.On the other hand, you also said that you like to think of yourself as smarter than anyone else and that you are proud that you can be one step ahead of adults. Is it possible that your reaction to the therapist is more of the same? If so, then it is important for you to work it through with the therapist. This might be the beginning of the important work you need to do.You see, therapy is not about a competition for who is smarter. You may well have a higher IQ than most. But there are different kinds of intelligence. A therapist has honed his or her skills in emotional intelligence as well as the intellectual. They can therefore often offer you a different perspective on your thoughts and feelings. Your job as a client is not to try to outsmart the therapist but to use your smarts to help yourself. Your therapist’s job is to introduce new information and alternative perspectives for you to consider.Something else for you to consider: A therapist has never seen anyone like the person in front of him or her at the time. Everyone is unique. Everyone’s story is their personal history and their personal experience. Everyone has their own language for trying to communicate what they think and feel. But here’s the thing: It’s also true that everyone is unique — just like everyone else. One of the remarkable things about people is that they are generally more alike than different. It gives everyone a place to start when making a new relationship, whether with a friend, a lover, or even a therapist. Then it is the ‘uniqueness”, the special qualities or combination of qualities of the individual. that makes him or her interesting. That’s often what we talk about in treatment.I don’t have enough information to know if you are mentally ill or paranoid.

They might just need more time to fully grasp the complexity of your thoughts and feelings.\n\nIdentify Key Thought or Belief:\nYour belief that you're more like a fox or wolf may stem from a core belief about your nature or worth. This thought could be an example of a cognitive distortion, where you might be overgeneralizing your intelligence and comparing it to a specific animal stereotype.\n\nPose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you tell me more about why you've developed this belief? Are there specific experiences or conversations that led to this way of thinking? It might be helpful to explore if there's a fear of being seen as human in a certain way, or if you're feeling like your intelligence sets you apart too much.\n\nProvide Strategy or Insight:\nInstead of focusing on labels, try to acknowledge your intelligence and embrace it. It's a valuable trait, but it doesn't define your entire being. During the therapy, discuss ways to build self-compassion and self-acceptance. You might also practice self-reflection, journaling, or talking to others about your feelings without comparing yourself.\n\nEncouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, therapy is a process, and it takes time to understand and work through these thoughts. It's okay if your therapist doesn't fully grasp it right away. Keep communicating openly and honestly, and they'll likely adjust their approach. If you find it challenging, don't hesitate to discuss how you can deepen your therapeutic relationship or seek additional support, such as a specialist or group therapy. You're not alone in this, and with time and understanding, you can regain a more secure sense of self.",

This is the essential spark for the motivation needed to make a change — and I am very glad you have written to us here.My best guess is that you pattern of pushing people away may have to do with intimacy concerns. This often explains why people are aware of the dance they do when relationships get closer, but aren’t aware that the very thing they are looking for scares them to the point where they push the person they want (or people they want) away.To help with this there are a number of suggestions given to those in relationships with someone who has an intimacy issue.

It's clear that your self-awareness is a crucial first step, as recognizing these patterns is essential for change. Let's work through this together using CBT principles.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nIt's completely normal to feel this way, and I can see how your past actions have caused hurt. You're taking responsibility for your actions, which is a positive step. Remember, change isn't easy, but it's possible.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nYour core belief here might be that you're inherently toxic or that you're unable to form meaningful relationships. This fear could be driving your behavior. Let's challenge this thought by asking: Is there evidence to support the idea that you're inherently bad at friendships, or is it more about past actions and learning from them?\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nInstead of dwelling on past mistakes, focus on the present moment and how you can improve. Reflect on what you wish you could have done differently in your friend's time of need. What specific actions can you take now to show support and prevent similar situations?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nTo change, try setting boundaries and practicing empathy. Learn to apologize when you do hurt someone and communicate openly about your feelings and limitations. Consider seeking professional help to develop healthier communication and relational skills. Gradually reintroduce activities that remind you of friends, but approach them with a growth mindset and a commitment to improvement.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, change takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories. Keep working on it, and don't hesitate to ask for help along the way. With practice, you can create a more positive future for your friendships.\n\nRemember, it's not about erasing the past, but learning from it to create a better present and future. You've already taken the first step, and with consistent effort, you can overcome this.",

            "Thank you for writing. I can’t make a diagnosis solely on the basis of a short letter, of course. But I can tell you that what you report is consistent with symptoms of depression.It is not unusual for young people who are recently graduated from high school to have a period of questioning. All of a sudden, somehow magically on graduation day, you are seen as an adult. Others probably expect you to have goals and the motivation to achieve them. Easier said than done. So do you.It’s a huge step into adulthood. Kids who have thought about it (and maybe stressed about it) for much of the senior year usually have figured out what they are going to do next, whether it is college or a job. Kids who avoided thinking about it find themselves quite suddenly without a plan for. This is a crisis of identity.Sadly, there are kids who try to solve the problem through partying or endlessly playing video games. It’s a grand scheme of avoidance that will certainly bite them later. Other kids sink into immobility, thinking if they don’t make a move, they won’t make a mistake. Of course, that doesn’t work either. Not moving is a mistake. Others get high or party, telling themselves they will think about it tomorrow. Somehow tomorrow never comes and they are in the same going nowhere rut a year from now. At least you haven’t added a layer of addiction to the original problem. Give yourself credit for that.The way out is probably therapy. Ask your mother to permit an evaluation by a mental health counselor. An evaluation often costs nothing. Unlike me, the counselor will be able to hear your complete story. They will then give you some ideas about what to do next. It is then your choice of whether or not to follow those suggestions.If you could figure this out on your own (or if your mom could), you would have done it already. Since you haven’t, the wise thing to do is to call in a consultant.I wish you well. "

Let's work through this together using the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n\n1. Validation and Empathy: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and disconnected after a major life transition like graduating. Your thoughts and feelings are valid, and it's okay to be asking these questions. Remember, I'm here to support you.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief: The main thoughts here are about time, reality, and your sense of self. A key belief might be that your doubts about time and reality are evidence of something significant or life-changing. This could be a manifestation of the \" catastrophizing\" or an overgeneralization.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection: Instead of assuming these doubts are a big deal, let's consider them objectively. Are there any concrete reasons or evidence to support these thoughts? Have you sought help from a professional or trusted adults? Sometimes, normal uncertainty after a change is a natural part of life.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: To address these doubts, try focusing on the present and engaging in activities that ground you in reality. Keep a routine, practice mindfulness, and reach out to loved ones for support. Also, remember that it's perfectly fine to question things and explore your beliefs, but it's important not to let them consume you. Gradually, you'll regain a sense of connection to your old self.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight: Remember, this process takes time. Keep working on these strategies, and don't hesitate to seek additional support if needed. It's common for people to experience transitional periods, and you're not alone. With time and effort, you'll regain your confidence and feel more in control.\n\nRemember, it's not about proving or disproving these doubts, but about learning to live with them while maintaining a healthy perspective.

            "Thank you for writing to us about your concerns. You mention that you are identified as an INFJ (introverted, intuitive, feeling, and judging) for the reader who may not be familiar, this is one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Sometimes referred to as the “Advocate” or the “Idealist,” people with INFJ personalities are creative, gentle, and caring. INFJs are usually reserved but highly sensitive to how others feel.While the MBTI is an interesting tool for some general personality dynamics it is often criticized on scientific grounds—yet remains very popular. For a discussion of its pros and cons read here.That having been said, the INFJ personality type strives for order and are typically good at picking up on the feelings of others but struggle to express their own. They typically are protective, and this means that they are slow to change as they are often protective of traditions and habits. I am not sure that this adequately describes you and your concerns. The main issue seems to be that you push on relationships so hard to make them better that you alienate others as you yourself feel alienated. This seems a bit more nuanced than a personality type generated by ISFJ.Striving for perfection in a relationship leaves everyone dissatisfied. Because nothing will ever be enough. This means that the main feedback you are giving to others is that you aren’t happy with them, they aren’t doing it right or good enough, and this leaves you feeling frustrated and them feeling pissed.The more important thing about your concerns isn’t your personality style so much as what you can do to have better interactions and less stressful encounters. The key seems to learn how to manage when you feel compelled to correct others. This is a skill-based intervention. Just because you have the feeling doesn’t mean you have to act on it. Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is good for this rather easy skill set to develop.I’ll encourage you to find a CBT therapist to work on this particular skill. I don’t think you need a personality overhaul as much as you need this ability.For readers who would like to learn what type you are you can take a quiz for free here."

        "cbt_answer": "I understand how you're feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to constantly improve relationships and the desire for a sense of contentment. It's common for people like you, with INFJ or ISFJ traits, to have a strong sense of responsibility and a desire for harmony. Here's how we can explore these thoughts and develop strategies to cope:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nIt's commendable that you care deeply about your relationships and want them to be the best they can be. However, it's essential to acknowledge that life is not always perfect, and sometimes things can't be fixed perfectly. You're not alone in feeling like your heart can't take it, and it's okay to experience intense emotions sometimes.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nYour core belief seems to be that you have to constantly strive for improvement, and even small changes can upset others. This might be influenced by your perfectionistic tendencies and the need for harmony. You might also feel like your introversion is a hindrance, thinking it affects your ability to be happy.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nInstead of seeing introversion as a problem, consider that it might be a strength that allows you to process emotions deeply. Reflect on if your perfectionism is realistic or if it's causing you unnecessary stress. Remember, it's not always about fixing things, but also about accepting them and finding a balance.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nTry setting realistic expectations for yourself and your relationships. Understand that sometimes things can't be perfect, and that's okay. Learn to communicate your needs and boundaries while also respecting others'. Consider working on self-compassion and accepting that not everything can be controlled. You might also benefit from finding ways to engage in introverted activities that bring you joy and fulfillment.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember that you're not alone in your struggles, and seeking support from friends or a therapist who understands your INFJ/ISFJ traits could be helpful. Gradually, as you practice accepting things as they are and managing your emotions better, your happiness may increase.

This goes on for a few months and then suddenly he turns “off.” One day I wake up and we are not connecting at the “normal” pace (i.e daily phone calls, a few texts, or plans for in person contact). The connection feels severed, there is an edge in his voice, and he is cold. I notice this, give it some space (2-3 days) and then intentionally and gently bring it up. Initially he is defensive but pretty quickly he will acknowledge that yes, he’s withdrawn and eventually some narrative will show up as a reason for the behavior – he felt I disrespected him (I was late returning a call), he felt I abandoned him (I had some trips and so I was out of town), he was nervous that I’d reject some of his behavior that he’d been hiding (he smokes occasionally), etc. The conversations come back on line and we talk about his feelings, needs, and better ways to communicate etc. He does have a therapist and I suggest he work on these issues with his therapist.

            "Whether or not you should stay with your partner is a very personal decision. That decision can be life altering. If you were to stay with him, the two of you may eventually consider marriage. Should you marry, you will be legally connected to him. This kind of decision requires a great deal of thought as it is one of the most important decisions you may ever make in life.You are right to be concerned. His behavior is problematic for the relationship. The proof of that is the problems it is causing. Should you decide to stay with him and he does not change, then you will have essentially agreed to accept his behavior. Are you willing to live with his behavior?You asked whether there’s anything you can do to soften the blow of his “off” experiences?” That is a difficult question to answer without knowing more about what precipitates these experiences. More information would be necessary to make that determination.If I could interview you in person, I would be interested in how long he has been in counseling and what progress has been made. It would be helpful to know more about what the therapist thinks is wrong? What happens when he shuts down? What is he thinking? Where does he go (literally) when he is like this? Does he stop talking altogether? How long has this been happening? Does he behave this way with other people? When did you notice it developing? What are the precursors to this behavior? Is he angry and hides so as to not physically harm you or is he feeling betrayed and can’t find the words to communicate his feelings? The answers to those questions, among others, will be important when determining whether or not you should move forward with this relationship.You mentioned that he has his own therapist and you see one separately (but that you’re in between therapists at the moment). Couples counseling may or may not be helpful. In any event, the fact that you both are open to counseling is a very good sign.Once you find a new therapist, he or she can assist you in exploring whether or not this relationship is right for you. You’ll want to examine your main question of what role, if any, do you play in how he behaves. He seems to be reacting to your behavior. Therapy is the ideal place to examine the dynamics of your relationship.His seems to be displaying extreme passive aggressive behavior. Passive-aggressive people are in fact aggressive in their behavior. Giving someone the “cold shoulder” is a bold expression without ever saying a word.The other problem with this type of behavior is that you never know what exactly precedes their behavior. People describe this experience as “walking on egg shells.” That expression essentially means having to be hypervigilant about what can set them off. That’s a very stressful way to live. It is impossible to communicate with someone who shuts down. Your boyfriend does eventually “come back online” but it’s important that he develop the ability to prevent his going “off” to begin with.The purpose of dating is to see if the two of you are a match. It’s an opportunity to spend time with an individual, to gauge their reactions, and get a sense of whether you want to make a more permanent commitment. If you see behavior that is concerning, then it’s time to rethink whether you want to stay in this relationship.At this point in time, it seems prudent to find a therapist and seriously examine whether or not this relationship is right for you. You need more information before deciding and a good therapist will be able to assist you in that process. Good luck with your decision. Please take care."

It only means you need to contact the prescriber and inform them of your circumstances.Another option is to contact your primary care physician. Even if they are not the original prescriber, they can make modifications to your medicine.There may be a community mental health treatment center you can go to for help. Many communities have them. Call to alert them to what is going on. They should be able to assist you in getting your needs met.Another option to consider is contacting your local mental health crisis team and alerting them to how you’re feeling. They can assist you immediately. The key is that you have to tell them how you feel so they know this is an emergency and you are on the verge of dangerous behavior. Crisis teams are typically staffed with a variety of mental health professionals, including psychiatrists. Psychiatrists prescribe medication and may be able to make a change to your medication to help you feel more stable.If there is no crisis team in your community, there may be an emergency facility where you can be evaluated for treatment.I understand that you do not wish to return to the psychiatric hospital, but if there are no other options, they can provide you with the most immediate assistance. Since you have previously been in the hospital, they might be in the best position to help, they know your case. They can treat your symptoms and help you to stabilize. Having an assessment at the hospital does not mean that you are going to be hospitalized. It means that they’re going to provide you with emergency assistance so that you feel better right away.If you know that something is wrong and that you are at risk of dangerous behavior, then it’s imperative that you seek emergency assistance. If you were to harm someone, you would likely go to jail. If you were to kill someone, you could be incarcerated for the rest of your life. If you stop and think about the consequences of your potential actions, you’ll realize the importance of seeking help now, and not waiting until it’s too late.The last thing in the world you want to do is go to prison. Prison is an awful place and you don’t want to risk winding up there simply because you chose not to seek help, when you needed it the most. Prisons do provide mental health treatment but the quality of care is substandard. This is primarily because prisons are not hospitals. Their main purpose is punishment.Yes, going to the hospital may not be what you want to do but it’s certainly better than what could happen if you were to “kill people, burn buildings,” etc. Be proactive, get the help you need now and do what you have to do to prevent yourself from engaging in dangerous behavior that could lead to the loss of your freedom.

It's sad to hear that you feel unheard and that your family's response doesn't offer the support you need.\n\nFirst, let's identify the key thought or belief here: \"No one cares until I have a full-blown crisis, and then they think I'm fine.\" This belief might be causing you to feel like your needs are being overlooked until things escalate.\n\nChallenge this thought: While it's true that some people might not immediately understand the severity of your situation, it's also important to remember that not everyone reacts the same way or has the same level of awareness. Your therapist has already committed to keeping you on medication, and that's a positive step. It's possible that a different medication or dosage might be needed to find the right balance.\n\nHere's a strategy for moving forward:\n\n1. Communicate clearly: Have an honest conversation with your therapist about your current experience and the medication you believe might be more effective. Be specific about the symptoms you're experiencing and how they've changed since being on 1 mg risperidone.\n\n2. Research online: While it's important to be cautious with online information, you can find resources and forums where people discuss mental health conditions and medications. You might find others who've had similar experiences and can offer advice or connect you with a supportive community.\n\n3. Consider alternative care: If your current therapist isn't responsive, look for another mental health professional who specializes in mood disorders or who is open to discussing your concerns. You might also seek a second opinion.\n\n4. Safety planning: If your suicidal or violent thoughts feel overwhelming, it's crucial to prioritize your safety. Talk to your therapist about creating a safety plan, which may include seeking emergency help, connecting with support groups, or finding a local crisis hotline.\n\n5. Address family dynamics: While it's not ideal, it might be helpful to address your concerns with your family in a calm and assertive manner. Let them know how their words and actions affect you and express your need for validation and understanding.\n\nRemember, it's normal to need time to find the right treatment, and it's not your fault if you haven't found the perfect solution yet. Keep advocating for your needs, and don't hesitate to seek professional help when you need it. You are not alone, and there are people who care and can assist you.",

            "It’s never good to rely on “Dr. Google.” “Dr. Google” is a reference to people who google their symptoms and diagnose themselves with what they learn. Part of the problem is that the information is too general and it can apply to almost anyone. It’s always best to consult a professional. They have the knowledge to both diagnose the problem and to provide the appropriate treatments.Without being able to interview you in-person and at length, my ideas about what could be wrong are speculative. You mentioned having difficulty thinking in an “organized systematic sequence” and “ideas almost never flow freely.” It’s difficult to know what precisely you meant here. A follow-up question I would have for you is when and how often does this occur? Is it only some of the time or is it after you’ve worked all day? Are you tired when it happens? Are you getting enough sleep?Sleep greatly impacts concentration. It would be difficult for anyone to focus without much sleep.In your example, you say that you have difficulty keeping track of the information unless you force yourself to concentrate. It’s possible that when you are conversing with someone, you are not necessarily listening to what they’re saying but rather anticipating your response. That would simply be a matter of not listening.You seem to be struggling with concentration. One explanation could be attention deficit problems. The formal diagnosis is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD. Individuals who struggle with ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity that interferes with their functioning. Some of the symptoms including: failing to pay close attention to details, having trouble holding attention on tasks, does not seem to listen when spoken to directly, trouble organizing tasks and activities, dislikes or avoids the required mental effort to focus on something long-term, and is easily distracted and forgetful.You also mentioned anxiety. Some of your symptoms are consistent with the possibility of anxiety. Medical problems should also be examined as they can affect one’s thinking and behavior. Brain injuries, sleep disorders, seizure disorders, can also affect one’s ability to concentrate.Alcohol or illegal substances can also cause some of the symptoms you are describing, as can certain medications.I would highly recommend consulting both a primary care physician to rule out medical problems and also a mental health professional for a clinical assessment. Once you meet with these professionals, you will have a better sense about what might be wrong but most importantly, how to treat your symptoms. Medication and/or psychotherapy may be recommended. Good luck with your efforts. Please take care."

        "cbt_answer": "Hello there! I understand how frustrating it can be to feel like you're stuck in a creative rut or dealing with constant mental activity that feels unfulfilling. Let's explore this together using CBT principles:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nIt sounds like you might be experiencing a sense of low motivation and a need for stimulation. It's quite common to have periods of boredom or creative blocks, and they can indeed feel like anxiety or a lack of engagement. Remember, it's normal to have these feelings from time to time.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nA potential thought or belief here could be, \"I need to always be productive and creative, or I'm not good enough.\" This belief might be causing you to feel anxious and contribute to the sense of your brain being \"asleep.\" Alternatively, you might be internalizing that your boredom is a sign of a problem rather than a natural fluctuation.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nIs it really true that you need constant stimulation or productivity? Are there times when you enjoy downtime and relaxation? Have you tried different activities to break through this block, or do you believe it's a fundamental aspect of your personality?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nTo cope with this, try incorporating a balanced approach. Allow yourself downtime and gentler activities that might spark creativity, like taking a walk, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in a hobby. Also, try changing your routine or setting small, achievable goals to reignite your motivation. Remember, it's okay to take a break and not feel guilty.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember that feeling bored or stuck is temporary. It's a moment in time, and your brain can adapt. If you find that these feelings persist or affect your daily life, don't hesitate to seek professional help. A therapist or counselor can provide additional guidance and coping strategies tailored to your specific needs.\n\nRemember, it's important to be kind and patient with yourself during this process. Progress takes time, and small changes can lead to significant improvements.",

Being “very sexual” is not an excuse for crossing boundaries with kids.No kid should feel scared and unsafe in her own home.

        "question": "I have been in a relationship with my best friend for five years. We are a great fit in all ways, but he frequently questions my integrity and his self-worth. A few years ago, I took a high paying job as a personal assistant. We were living in a bad neighborhood and I jumped at the opportunity to make more money- without questioning the logistics. It ended up being a personal assistant to a pimp, arranging dates, managing money, and sending out ads for the girls. We talked about what my job would entail, and he was not happy with it, but agreed that we needed the money and it wouldn’t be forever. A few months after I started, my boss forced me to do something not in my job description. In the situation, I feared for my life, so I obliged. I didn’t show up for my shift the next day, hoping it would all just go away and I could find a different job quickly. I started receiving threatening phone calls. My boss demanded all the money he had paid me back ($20,000). He had a copy of my ID and social from the hiring process. He made it very clear that my life was in his hands. I worked as a sex worker for a year and a half to pay him back in full. During that time, my boyfriend found out about it and understandably flipped out. Our marriage plans went out the window, I was forced out of our friend group, and was left to deal with the aftermath alone. That was two years ago, and we are in a much better place now. But for him, marriage still isn’t on the table and his friends haven’t welcomed me back. He says that he often blames himself for not figuring it out sooner, and blames me for not coming to him for help. I try to explain to him that I was scared to involve anyone else for fear of what would happen to them, but he just doesn’t understand why I didn’t go to the cops. I’m afraid this occurrence will always be a stain on my relationship resume with him, and that he will only see his pain of feeling betrayed and cheated on, when that was not my intention. Can we work towards forgiveness? Or am I wasting my time? (From the USA)",

            "There are several layers here, and I am very appreciative of your courage and resilience in discussing the issues. What is clear is that this isn’t a situation you alone got yourself into. Your boyfriend was very much part of the process and dynamics that got you into the dilemma in the first place. This wasn’t something you did on your own to benefit yourself.There are three important questions here that you need to answer for yourself. First, is marriage what you want? Are you looking for that in your life at this time or is this relationship good enough for now. In other words, does the relationship you have with your boyfriend meet enough of your needs for now. If marriage is no longer a big deal for you then this might be okay enough.Does your boyfriend’s unforgiveness knock him out of the running for a good long term partner? If you do want to get married does it feel as if your partner won’t be able to get over this? If marriage is what you want then let him know this in no uncertain terms. If he can’t forgive you and will hold resentment toward you then it is not worth going forward. He may feel that if he forgives you that he will lose his friends, or that he is settling rather than working through. But if he can’t get past this and you want to get married then you’ll have to let him know the relationship can’t go forward. In these terms, he can’t give you what you want and need.Finally, I’d encourage you both to read this book Forgive For Good, and find a workshop specifically focused on forgiveness. In addition, you may want to find a couple’s counselor who can help the two of you work together on this.There are two elements of forgiveness. There is forgiveness of the other and unforgiveness. The unforgiveness has little to do with the situation or another person. It has to do with the feelings you have that negatively ruminate about the situation. People can be unforgiving about someone who has passed on — or a situation that is long since dissolved but the bitterness remains.Perhaps is a good place to start because your unforgiveness of yourself and your boyfriends lack of concern for you during that time may be beneath the whole situation. One way to break this cycle of unforgiveness is with self-compassion. As it’s essence self-compassion is being able to treat yourself like a good friend would treat you. Nurturing yourself in this way can ease the discomfort of the past — while setting the stage for not only being more tolerant of yourself and your boyfriend. Obviously, this works best when both of you work at this level.Here is a brief video on self-compassion you may find interesting to help you connect with that part of yours or that needs nurturing.Wishing you patience and peace, "

It's understandable that this would have a significant impact on your relationship and self-perception.\n\nFirst, let's validate your feelings: It's natural to feel betrayed and hurt by what happened, and the fear and uncertainty you experienced must have been overwhelming. I can imagine how this experience has created doubt about your integrity and self-worth, which your partner's concerns may be rooted in.\n\n1. Key Thought or Belief: It seems like one core belief is that your partner feels responsible for not detecting the issue sooner, and that you're at fault for not going to the authorities. This belief may lead to the perception that forgiveness is not possible or that the past will always define your relationship.\n\n2. Pose Challenge or Reflection: Can you consider that his feelings and reactions are a result of his own fear, vulnerability, and the impact it had on both of you? Have you talked about how his trust might be impacted and how that's affecting your marriage plans? Also, have you explored your own feelings about not seeking help from others earlier?\n\n3. Provide Strategy or Insight: Addressing these beliefs together might involve open and honest communication about your experiences, fears, and the reasons behind your decisions. You might work on developing a plan to rebuild trust, such as seeking therapy for your relationship and personal growth. It's important to remember that forgiveness is a process, and it may take time.\n\n4. Encouragement and Foresight: While it's true that the past can't be changed, your future can be. By acknowledging the past and working on healing together, you can build a stronger foundation for your relationship. It's important to recognize that forgiveness is a choice, not a guarantee, but it's a necessary step towards moving forward.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and set boundaries that protect your emotional health. You don't have to rush into forgiveness, but allowing yourselves to work through these challenges can lead to a more resilient and loving relationship in the long run.\n\nTake your time, and don't hesitate to seek support from a therapist or trusted friends as you navigate this process.",

            "Thank you for writing. What I think is that you aren’t ready to be in a committed monogamous relationship. There is no shame in that. I’ve become increasingly concerned over the last few years that teens feel the pressure to be in committed relationships and to be sexually intimate, ready or not. The culture of many high schools demands that people have a girlfriend or boyfriend. The result is often a “serial” monogamy where people see one person for awhile, go through a painful break-up, then find someone new where the same thing happens.The problem, to me, isn’t about trust or the ability to be in a relationship or sexuality. It’s about the fact that the teen years are supposed to be a time of exploration. This is the period when you find out about yourself and about the type of person you want to be with. That can only happen if you get to know a number of people you are interested in and resist the pressure to “settle down.” 17 is not the age to do that.I think you “cheat” as a way to give yourself permission to explore other relationships. Unfortunately, since you pledge monogamy, this leaves you feeling bad about yourself and makes the other person feel rejected and betrayed. It would be more honest and healthier for you to tell guys you are dating that you aren’t ready to be exclusive. You may not be ready to have sex with every guy you are interested in either. That’s absolutely okay.Being up front with your unwillingness to be someone’s one and only for now (and acting on it) will prevent you from feeling like a “slut” and will prevent the guys from feeling betrayed.I wish you well,"

That is especially true with medication. It’s common for people to have to try different medications to find the one they like or that works best for them. Even when they find something that works, after a while, they often need an adjustment in dosage or a new medication altogether.You also mentioned therapy. It wasn’t successful thus far but that doesn’t mean it won’t be in the future. I always recommend that people contact four or five therapists. Interview them over the phone and ask them many questions. These questions can include: How would you characterize my problem? How would you treat my problem? How much experience do you have? Have you helped other people with similar problems and how have those people fared? What would your strategy be for treating me? Do you think you could help me and if so, how would you do it?Then, you would want to ask practical questions such as: Do you take my insurance? How much are co-pays? How soon could you see me? How often should our sessions be? When could I expect to feel better?Therapists are very different from one another. They vary in their strategies. Some are certainly better than others. Choosing a therapist takes time. It’s important to find the one you like, are comfortable with and who you think has the best chance of helping you. That is the therapist who will likely be your best match.Once you begin treatment, you should feel at least a little better after each session. If that’s not happening, it may be time to find a new therapist.The problems you have described are highly treatable. Depression and anxiety are two of the most common disorders in the world. The fact that you’ve already tried treatment and are open to trying it again is very good. You are moving in the right direction. Your openness and willingness to engage in treatment significantly increases the probability of overcoming these issues. It’s important to highlight that fact, since many people refuse to seek treatment and suffer with treatable problems. Thankfully, that is not the case with you.A common complaint among clients regarding treatment is that they hate to start all over again, with a new therapist. They don’t like the idea of having to retell their entire life stories all over again. It’s an understandable complaint but finding the right therapist is well worth the effort. There are good therapists who can help you but it isn’t always easy to find them. You have to search for them. Consider my advice, above, about contacting four or five therapists, and hopefully you’ll find one you like.You have the right attitude regarding treatment, which will significantly increase the likelihood of your success.

It's commendable that you've tried different medications and also engaged in CBT, but it's understandable that the results haven't been as expected. Let's work through your concerns together, using the structure of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nI can see that you're dealing with a lot of self-consciousness and fear related to your everyday behaviors. It's understandable to feel anxious and overwhelmed by the constant monitoring of yourself. You're not alone in this, and it takes courage to seek help.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nOne key thought that might be contributing to your anxiety is the belief that your \"normal\" self feels strange, which in turn leads to the need for control. This could be a distorted perception of your own body and emotions. This belief might be creating a vicious cycle where the more you try to control, the more anxious you become.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you consider if your anxiety is a result of perfectionism or the fear of being \"not good enough\"? It's possible that the monitoring you're doing is a way to avoid the discomfort of not meeting your own unattainable standards. Also, are there any specific situations or triggers that exacerbate these feelings?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nWhile the process of recovery might take time, it's essential to approach it with patience and a growth mindset. Instead of trying to control your symptoms, try practicing self-compassion and acceptance. Mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation, can help you manage your anxiety in the moment. Also, consider seeking a therapist trained in exposure therapy, which can help you gradually face and tolerate uncomfortable situations.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember that recovery is a journey, and it's okay if progress feels slow. Don't give up on finding what works best for you. It might take some trial and error, but the right combination of therapy, medication, and self-care will pay off. Be patient with yourself and seek support from loved ones and professionals along the way.\n\nPlease consider discussing these suggestions with your healthcare provider, as they'll be best equipped to tailor a treatment plan that suits your specific needs. They might also recommend additional resources or alternative therapies. Remember, it's a process, and with time and persistence, you can regain control of your life.",

It brings no joy to me and it really bothers me. However, I understand that no human can live this wonderful life all of the time and be scott free without seeing some things that bother them. In my case, I’ve seen some very horrible things, mostly car accidents and family members who have died from various diseases and being mortified and shocked at them having no life anymore. I’m very sensitive to such things as well and it effects me more than anyone else I know and it bothers me. Even a dead deer on the side of the road traumatizes me for the day or seeing some zombies. One particular day, however, sealed the deal with me being pretty much traumatized constantly. So I’m 13 years old and I’m going to a doctor’s appointment and I see an old man with his skull crushed in and the insides of his head splattered all over the highway from a Semi hitting him in his car. Imagine how mortified I was. I didn’t speak for a whole day as a matter of fact and I cried the whole night. That perhaps sealed the deal with me being shocked. So fast forward to me being 20 now and I’m upset that I can’t be happy because I am in this constant state of shock and I do these thousand yard stares yet think and feel nothing because I’ve seen what horrors the world has offered.

            "Perhaps without realizing it, you seem to have been describing the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). An assessment with a mental health professional, in-person, will help to determine whether a PTSD diagnosis is warranted.PTSD is a disorder that sometimes develops after an individual has experienced a horrific, frightening or shocking event. You have described experiencing several of those.Virtually everyone will experience a number of reactions after a shocking or traumatic event. That’s natural and to be expected. However, when those reactions last longer than they should, and disrupt your life long after the events have passed, that’s often indicative of PTSD.For an individual to be diagnosed with PTSD, their symptoms must last for more than a month, and significantly interfere with relationships, and their everyday lives. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual For Mental Disorders (DSM), some of the symptoms include: experiencing recurrent, involuntary and intrusive distressing memories and dreams about the trauma; experiencing dissociative reactions including flashbacks in which the traumatic event(s) feels like it’s reoccurring; experiencing intense or prolonged psychological distress when exposed to cues that remind you of the traumatic event(s); having physiological reactions to cues that remind or resemble the traumatic event(s); attempting to avoid certain stimuli that remind you of the traumatic event; experiencing emotional reactions associated with the traumatic event, including the persistent or exaggerated negative beliefs and expectations about oneself, others, and the world; feelings of hyper-vigilance, sleep problems, concentration problems, and so forth.Those are some of the experiences, reactions and cognitive affects associated with PTSD. It seems as though you have described a number of them in your letter. If you have never received treatment for your symptoms, then it would make sense that you feel the way you do. It’s important to know that treatment exists for these symptoms. If you are open to treatment, you can be helped.It’s great that you have your horses. It’s also great that you are attempting to connect with God. Assuredly those strategies help to ease your emotional pain but they are not enough, at least not at this time. They are helpful adjuncts to treatment but they should not be considered substitutes for treatment.I would encourage you to contact a mental health professional who specializes in PTSD. Treatment may involve trauma-focused psychotherapies including prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Other treatments may include medication and hypnotherapy, among others.Meet with a mental health professional to begin treatment. Choose a therapist who makes you feel the most comfortable. You are not destined for a lonely life. You were a victim of trauma through no fault of your own. You can overcome these issues with treatment. I encourage you to give it a try. Good luck. Please take care."

        "cbt_answer": "First, I want to validate your feelings and empathize with the profound impact that the traumatic experiences have had on your emotional well-being. It's understandable that you struggle with enjoying the world around you, given the constant shock and emotional distress you've experienced.\n\nKey Thought/Belief: Your core belief seems to be that your innocence and happiness have been permanently stolen, leading to a constant state of shock and detachment. You feel like you can't be happy because you can only cope through external means like hugging horses.\n\nChallenge/Reflection: Have you considered that it might be helpful to reframe your thoughts and explore the possibility of healing and adaptation over time? While it's normal to have memories that affect our emotions, it's also important to remember that most people can find moments of joy despite their past experiences.\n\nStrategy or Insight: You might want to try cognitive restructuring, a technique in CBT that involves questioning and challenging those negative thoughts. Instead of focusing solely on the traumas, maybe you could practice mindfulness to tune into the present and find moments of peace or beauty in small things. Gradually, with time and exposure to different situations, your emotional reactions might become less severe.\n\nEncouragement and Foresight: It's crucial to remember that healing is a process and it takes time. Don't expect to suddenly feel completely \"normal\" or happy, but strive to develop coping mechanisms that work for you. If you find it challenging, consider seeking professional help from a therapist who specializes in trauma or a mental health professional who can guide you through these processes. Also, remember that you are not alone, and there are others who have gone through similar experiences and found ways to heal.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's understandable to feel overwhelmed, it's important to acknowledge that you have the capacity to grow and change. By working on your thoughts and seeking support, you can start to rebuild your connection to happiness and joy in your daily life.",

        "question": "From a teen in the U.S.: My parents are talking me into going to college every day, even though I tried telling them that I’m not college ready. Is there any way to solve this?",

            "Please tell your parents that sending you to college when you aren’t ready is a total waste of their money. Kids who go to college without personal motivation and goals don’t take advantage of the classes and experience. Often they end up partying too much and studying too little. Often they drop out or flunk out, feeling ashamed and like failures. Often they become depressed.This can all be avoided by taking a gap year or two. A “gap year” is a year between high school and college that is devoted to something besides school and that gives you new experiences and a time to figure out your own goals. It is not a year to just hang out.  It is a year for adventures that stretch you and that give you some experience with something you think you might want to do in your life.There are formal gap year experiences as well as informal ones. Formal ones are sponsored and maintained by organizations. There are programs here in the states and there are programs that take you to another country like India or South Africa. Most give you the opportunity to explore yourself by helping others. Most cost very little. Some even provide a stipend.A teen I know who thought she might be interested in education signed up for a year with CityYear. CityYear is an Americorps program that places young people in high need schools. With placement in a city far from where she was raised, she got to stretch her wings further by learning about another place and how to navigate being far from home. She also came away from her time there with a commitment to becoming a high school teacher.An informal “gap year” is an experience you create for yourself. One student I know, for example, thought that maybe she wanted to become a journalist. She networked in her town and was able to work with the local newspaper to set up a year long internship. She ended up falling in love with the marketing department. She’s now in school as a business major, majoring in marketing.If you think a trade might be for you, see if you can find a job or internship with an electrician or carpenter or plumber — whatever interests you, Assisting for a few months to a year can help you decide.If a gap year isn’t for you: Consider starting school very part time. There may be a local community college where you can explore a course or two that interests  you.Meanwhile, find a job and save your money. Hopefully, find a job that gives you more experience than flipping burgers. See if you can find part time work in human services or in a field that you think you might want to pursue. A job in retail doesn’t have to be just ringing up purchases. Talk to the HR department, for example, about how to get some experience with buying or managing or display if any of that intrigues you. The point is to figure out what might help you make a decision and go for it.You might find it helpful to read this article.I suggest you stop arguing with your parents about who is right and start taking responsibility for finding out what you can do instead of college. Research gap year opportunities or make one of  your own. Your school guidance department probably has some brochures. Talk to a counselor there.Present your folks with a plan and a promise to revisit the college question after you’ve had the chance to explore yourself. Remind them that they will save thousands of dollars if  you go to school when and if you are ready. It”s a win-win.I wish you well. "

        "question": "My brother is a paranoid schizophrenic with bipolar disorder autism and adhd. His schizophrenia comes with homicidal thoughts. He’s been admitted into a hospital before and was being treated for years. About a year ago now he went off of his meds and it’s been downhill from there. He’s currently in a manic state and has been for months. He refuses to get back on his medications and it’s taking a toll on him and everyone else. He’s violent, combative, and just dangerous. Anyone he sees in his way is a target. He has harmed my mother’s dog. Tried to hurt my toddler (he is no longer around her anymore at all). He’s choked my mom stolen her car, loosened the lugnuts on her tire and when she went to drive away her tire fell off. He’s assaulted a police officer threatened multiple times to kill people. It hasn’t gotten to the point where even my mom had to move out. We’ve called the crisis line, the police, even adult protective services and no one will do anything about it. He’s going to seriously hurt someone or himself and I can’t bear the thought of standing back and watching him drown. He’s destroyed his apartment and belongings. We are at a loss for what to do. We can’t force him to get back on his medications because he is still his power of attorney. We can’t force him to seek treatment at all. Is there anything we can do? He keeps racking up charges for himself and jail is not the place he needs to be. He is a really amazing docile person when he’s medicated, but when he’s not he’s one of the scariest people I’ve ever seen. What can we do?",

            "Desperate times call for desperate measures. If you haven’t tried this already, contact an attorney who specializes in guardianship/power of attorney and explore having your brother declared mentally incompetent. Generally speaking, an individual can be declared incompetent when their mental capacity inhibits their ability to make decisions that are not in their best interest. Each state likely has specific guidelines for what constitutes this type of declaration. An attorney who specializes in these matters should be able to assist you to determining if this is the right move for your brother.In the meantime, there are several things you can do that may help. One is contacting the Treatment Advocacy Center. On their website, you will find information about the laws and standards regarding involuntary commitment in your state. They also have resources for families who are dealing with situations like yours. There’s also great information on their website about guardianship, emergencies, etc.Using the aforementioned website, you should be able to determine whether your state uses some form of assisted outpatient treatment (AOT). AOT involves a judge mandating that an individual, who had been previously hospitalized and who is now living in the community, adhere to their treatment plan or be rehospitalized. AOT may be applicable in your situation.Try to determine if your county has a mental health court via a Google search. Mental health courts are specialty courts for individuals with severe mental illnesses who have violated the law. Generally, they only admit participants who have committed a crime however, they may be able to help your brother since he has a history of being in jail. Given his involvement in the legal system, he may be eligible for mental health court which, if accepted, would mandate treatment compliance or risk going to jail. If that is not a possibility, the people who work for the mental health court may be a good resource for your family.I would also recommend contacting your local National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) group. NAMI is an advocacy organization that specializes in assisting families who have loved ones with severe mental illnesses. They offer free support groups in local communities. Many of the NAMI members are seasoned veterans who know how to navigate the mental health system. They can provide both peer support and guidance.It would also be wise to proactively contact your local crisis team. It’s good to make them aware of your situation and concerns. You might do the same with the local police department. These preemptive steps might help everyone be more prepared in the event of an emergency.It’s important to keep yourself safe. Research indicates that when individuals with severe mental illnesses do engage in violent acts, it is often directed at their family members. Perhaps that is because family members are quite literally in the vicinity, making it easier for them to become targets. When someone is actively symptomatic, they are not behaving as they normally would. They might do something that they wouldn’t otherwise do.I’m very sorry that this is happening to you. I have worked with families dealing with this very type of situation. I know how difficult it can be. Few truly understand what you’re going through. There are simply not enough resources available for families faced with this situation. I hope that some of my advice has helped, if only a little.Please don’t hesitate to write again if you have additional questions. Stay safe and please take care."

Also, it might be helpful to explore if there are any underlying concerns about the side effects or how the medication makes him feel unwell.\n\n4.

            "You are asking a very important question. The reason you find rewards like alcohol and drugs unrewarding is that they are artificial rewards. They have nothing to do with the act that is being rewarded. Thus they ring hollow. Often people keep giving themselves more and more of these phony rewards in an effort to, finally, feel rewarded but they are entirely missing the point.True gratification comes inherently from being totally and pleasurably involved in what you are doing. Positive Psychologists often quote Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi who, in 1975, named the ultimate internal gratification as “flow”.  He said, “Flow is being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz”. Some people call it being “in the zone”.Other writers have emphasized that the only true way to positive self-esteem is to do good in the world. Doing good is something to feel good about. Doing good makes people feel good which motivates them to do more good things that contribute to the world.Nathaniel Branden, author of The Six Pillars Self-Esteem, said “How do we keep our inner fire alive? Two things at minimum are needed: An ability to appreciate the positives in our life — and a commitment to action.” That “inner fire” is the reward that matters.I’m sure you have at some time in your life experienced this, You get so into what you’re doing that time flies, you feel great, you get something accomplished that really matters to you. It’s a better high than any drug or drink or party can provide.My advice to you is to stop worrying about whether others are getting rewards you are not getting by partying. You aren’t missing a thing. Shoot for the inner satisfaction and gratification that is available to all of us if we stop looking outside of ourselves for rewards and instead do the things that make life joyful.I wish you well,"

        "question": "My brother’s always been a shy child, but he had a good relationship with family and friends. In his teenage years, he started to withdraw. I was the only one to whom he kept talking. He began to spend most of the day in his bedroom. He also began to use monosyllable words to reply to my parents, aunts, cousins… Never started a conversation unless you addressed him. Now, at 19 (almost 20), it has evolved to the point he doesn’t talk to anybody, not even to me, and not even with monosyllables. He doesn’t look anybody in the face either (he didn’t do that a few years ago). If I try to talk to him, he ignores me or makes a sound of annoyance and kicks me out of his bedroom. He is very childish too, in the sense that it is part of his routine to watch cartoons with his favorite stuffed toys (he refuses to throw toys away). He prefers their company to that of people. I don’t even know if he has friends. He certainly avoids his college peers. He has dinner alone and goes to sleep early (I bet it is only to avoid us too). He only goes out if he needs to get a book in the library or if he has to go to college. Otherwise, you’ll find him home. Is he afraid to become an adult? Could that be the reason he behaves like a child despite being almost 20? Could he have social anxiety? Autism, even? Maybe Aspergers. Some symptoms coincide: • Difficulty to socialize and make friends; isolation • Rigid routines (he gets distressed if he can’t follow them) • Fear of change (he doesn’t want to throw old/broken things away) • Hygiene issues (he rarely showers and shaves and he never uses deodorant) • Sensitivity to noises and light • Repetitive motor mannerisms (which he didn’t have as a child) If he had autism, though, he would have some speech difficulties, wouldn’t he? He actually uses sarcasm and understands it perfectly. Never shown any speech delay either. Besides, I think I read someone is born autistic, so he can’t become autistic at the age of 18. It’s been an evolution, that’s why I’m not sure what is going on. Is he just a very immature teenager or does he have a condition? (From Spain)",

            "Your deep concern for your brother is admirable and your research about his condition is impressive. I can understand why you might think he has autism.Since 2013 the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) has classified Autistic disorder, Asperger’s, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Rett’s disorder all under the title of “autism spectrum disorder.” While it would not be possible to offer an official diagnosis, here is a brief online quiz that might help in identifying if your suspicions about your brother’s behavior are correct.Typically, there are two major criteria in the classification of autism: Communication deficits and abnormal behaviors — so your concern is justified. His monosyllabic speech and repetitive mannerisms and lack of eye contact fit these categories. You can find greater details about autism diagnosis here. More information about Asperger’s is here, and Retts Syndrome here. There is also a wonderful memoir, Look Me In The Eye: My Life With Aspergers by John Elder Robison that is excellent.But there may be a number of other possibilities causing his reaction and only qualified mental health or medical providers can make an accurate diagnosis. The fact that he is in college and cares about his grades is important. He may have all these reactions, but he must still be motivated academically. Having goals and needing to put the effort in toward them is always a powerful way to help someone — regardless of the diagnosis.Also, the university will typically have a counseling center, which you could suggest for him to go to as a way of preparing for whatever will follow graduation.If he is unwilling to go to the counseling center offer to go with him to get a physical check-up. A number of the other possibilities for his symptoms may be medical and a physician would be able to note this or make arrangements for follow-up evaluations.I wish you well in looking for some solutions for your brother. He is lucky to have you as a sister.Wishing you patience and peace, "

In college he had a short phase where he was a bit more social. It is now about 4 years since he has graduated college. In that time he has not worked any job. He gets angry when people try to tell him to think about the future and what he wants to do with his life. He lives alone in an apartment that my parents own in Queens (we live on Long Island). He barely goes outside. He orders things to his apartment, even food so he doesnt go outside (he doesn’t know how to drive either). He mainly just plays video games online and sleeps. It seems like he has some hidden form of cash flow that we do not know of since he buys himself things on Amazon quite frequently. He is extremely moody and can get in quite negative angry moods towards others. This has been 4 years and I am not sure what to do. He himself does not seem open for us trying to help, when my parents try to have a more serious talk with him he gets extremely angry and then will say extreme things to get them to stop talking, like “This will be the last you will ever see me. I will move to Sweden” (he is currently dating a girl online from Sweden who has recently come to visit him in NY).

Unless he’s a danger to himself or to others, you are severely limited in how you can intervene.It’s important to scale back your expectations about how much power you have over this situation. You cannot force him to be motivated. You cannot force him to have interests in things that he’s not interested in. You cannot force him to be a different person. He’s doing what he wants and what makes him happy. As an adult, it’s up to him to decide how he lives his life. You may not agree with it. It’s probably not how you would live your life but he has the right to live how he wants, right or wrong.Your parents may have the only leverage in this situation. He is living in their apartment. He lives there even though your parents are unhappy with his behavior.Because your parents allow him to live in their apartment, despite their unhappiness with how he treats them and how he behaves, they may be enabling his behavior.

He faces no consequences.As you mentioned in your letter, he makes threats about moving to Sweden and suicide. This is probably why no one forces the issue. He may make those threats because he knows that the family will back off and leave him alone. Thus, he can continues living in the apartment rent free, doing what he wants and nothing changes. He apparently recognizes that no one will bother him if he makes those threats. Understandably, you’re worried that he’s going to carry out those threats.

You can try talking to your brother and explaining your concerns but it may not make a difference. Your parents have the power to ask him to move out of the apartment. That would force him to at least make changes to his living arrangements.Anytime that he threatens suicide, you should call the mental health crisis team or the authorities. That’s the most appropriate way to deal with a threat of suicide.Sometimes people threaten suicide as a way to manipulate others into behaving in a particular way. That may be what is happening but you would never want to risk the possibility of his attempting suicide. Mental health professionals can ensure that this matter is handled correctly and safely.You might also consider family therapy. Your brother is unlikely to attend but you can make the offer. If he’s unwilling, you and your parents might benefit from a few sessions with a mental health professional, for guidance in how to handle this situation. It’s always good to seek the advice of trained professionals when dealing with difficult situations.I wish I had more options for you to consider. Unfortunately, you’re dealing with a difficult situation. It can be excruciating to watch someone you love engage in behavior that you know is not in their best interest. To sit on the sidelines and do nothing is a helpless feeling but sometimes that is the reality of the situation. Try everything you can to make positive changes in your brother’s life. Once you’ve done that, you will have done all that you can do. Good luck with your efforts. Please take care."

        "cbt_answer": "First, I want to express my empathy for your concern and the challenging situation you're facing with your brother. It's natural to worry about someone we care about who seems stuck in a pattern that's affecting not only their life but also their relationships. Let's approach this using CBT principles to help you navigate the situation effectively.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nI understand how concerned and helpless you must feel. It's important to acknowledge your brother's feelings and experiences, while also respecting his boundaries. It's crucial to maintain a non-judgmental and supportive atmosphere as you try to engage with him.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nFrom the information provided, potential key beliefs or thoughts your brother might have could be:\n\n- \"I don't need to think about my future because I'm happy playing video games and sleeping alone.\"\n- \"I can avoid responsibilities by hiding my financial situation.\"\n- \"If people try to help, I'll lose control or they'll embarrass me.\"\n- \"My anger and mood swings are a way to protect myself from vulnerability.\"\n- \"Parents and their expectations are overwhelming, so I'll push back or disappear.\"\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nLet's encourage your brother to reflect on these thoughts. You could say something like, \"I know these situations might feel overwhelming, but what if we could talk about why you feel电竞 (video games) and not engaging with the outside world provides you comfort?\"\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nHere are some strategies you could suggest to him:\n\n- Encourage a dialogue about his interests and passions, and explore potential career paths that align with them.\n- Suggest finding local events or clubs that align with his hobbies to meet new people and expand his social circle.\n- Help him learn basic life skills, such as cooking, budgeting, and driving, which can increase his independence.\n- Teach him communication skills to manage anger and negative moods in a healthier way.\n- Instead of avoiding conversations about the future, propose setting small, achievable goals together.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember to be patient, as change takes time. Keep the lines of communication open, but also respect his boundaries if he needs space. Let him know you're there for him, but you won't force anything. If his resistance to help persists, consider seeking professional support, such as a therapist or counselor, who can guide the conversation and provide additional strategies.\n\nIn the end, remember that change is a process, and your role is to be a supportive presence, not an enforcer. By offering guidance and understanding, you're already taking the first step towards a positive change.",

            "Thank you for writing. I think you already know that her choice to change jobs isn’t about you. Having raised you and your sister with the stability and consistency of being with you in the same school, she now sees an opportunity for change. My guess is that she needs to stretch herself in new ways and can’t do so in a place where expectations are that she will continue as she always has. It’s something to celebrate that she is willing to take the risk and explore something new and different.It’s possible that you are grieving childhood’s end. Your mother’s decision to move on in her career does indicate that your childhood is over. Like most adult children, there is a part of  you that wants to hold time still; that wants nothing to change at “home” while you make all the changes. It does offer some comfort and security to think that way. But parents are people too. It’s natural for them to want to grow and change too.I’m glad you aren’t sharing your extreme reactions with your mother. You are probably right that she needs and appreciates your support, just as you often need hers. If you can’t help her move her personal things without breaking down, maybe you should find another way to be helpful.If this explanation isn’t enough to help you make sense of your tears, please do consider seeing a therapist for a few sessions to work it through.I wish you well.

It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when something you're familiar with and close to, like your mother's teaching career, is causing stress. Let's explore this together using a CBT approach.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nI can see how this situation might be causing you anxiety, knowing it holds such personal and emotional significance. It's normal to feel attached and worried about the well-being of loved ones.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nIt seems your core belief could be, \"If I don't understand or support her decision, it means I'm not showing my love or being supportive.\" This belief might be causing you to overanalyze the situation or feel responsible for her choices.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you tell me more about the specific issue you're facing? Are you concerned about her well-being, her job satisfaction, or something else? Or perhaps you're worried about the transition for the school or her students? By understanding the root of your concern, we can better challenge this belief.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nRemember, it's not your job to control or guarantee her happiness in her job. Your support can come in terms of listening, offering advice when asked, or simply being present. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns and how you can both navigate this together. Additionally, consider seeking support for yourself if you need to process your emotions.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nYou've taken the first step by seeking help. Keep in mind that change and transitions can be challenging for anyone, including your mother. Encourage her to share her feelings and feelings with you, and together, you can find ways to support each other through this transition. Remember, it might take time, but with patience and understanding, you'll both find a way to move forward.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for professional help if you feel the need.

            "This doesn’t seem to be a question as much as it is a statement. It sounds clear that you don’t like it and want it to stop — but seem to be wanting some guidance in how to deliver the message. Toward this end I am suggesting it is time for an important discussion in your relationship. There are five things that are going on that need some attention on your end before this can take place:First, the boundaries are too muddied. Why does her friend move into your house—and then sleep at her place? Let’s get this cleared up because it makes no sense and certainly doesn’t sound like it was part of what you signed up for. What were you expecting, and is this still the case? This needs to be explained. Perhaps there is a good explanation that no one has explained (such as proximity to work) but this needs to be articulated so it can be understood.Secondly, have you and she talked about this? It doesn’t seem so from your email. Does she know your discomfort? If she does is she ignoring it, defending against it, or dismissing it? Or, is it that you have simply not talked to her about it? She needs to understand your feelings. However, before you can express them to her you’ll need to understand them yourself. Take some time to sort this all through in your own mind. Do you feel betrayed? Are you angry? Disappointed? Miffed? Try to figure out what it is you are feeling so it can be accurately expressed.Next, what prompted you to have him come stay with you? What were the arrangements and expectations? Somehow, if it were known that he’d move in and you’d be left alone in your place while he is with your girlfriend, you’d not have agreed to it. I think you need to chat with him about your initial thoughts with this arrangement. Does he know your feelings? Think a bit about what your point of view is and then have the discussion.Is this a deal breaker? What if both of them (or either one of them) are not willing to change. What will you do? Do you end the relationship? Do you have him move out? Or do you find ways to cope? Think this through before saying something. While it is difficult to think about it is better to run through all the options in your mind first so you’ll have done some thinking about what you’ll do if things go south. None of these thoughts have to be acted on, but it is often a good idea to think about them so you can have a sense of where your thinking is at.Finally, don’t sit on this too long. The resentment that will build from you not speaking up will eventually spill over and disrupt your relationship(s). Find a way to confront this situation sooner rather than later.Wishing you patience and peace, "

It's important to acknowledge your feelings without judgment.\n\n2.

Have you talked to your girlfriend about how this affects you, and her perspective on it?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nCommunication is key. Talk to your girlfriend openly about your feelings, and ask if she understands your perspective. If possible, set clear boundaries about when he can spend the night, or find alternative times for them to hang out when you're around. This could help maintain the friendship while respecting your feelings.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, friendships often evolve, and this dynamic might change over time.

I don’t think you’ve done anything wrong.  It sounds to me like your father is too wrapped up in his own problems to understand the normal needs and activities of a girl your age.

Your sisters are also so focused on their own lives that they may have forgotten what it is like to be an early teen. You don’t mention a mother so I’m guessing that for some reason she isn’t in the picture.My guess is that the reason you don’t have as many friends as you’d like is related to your isolation. You aren’t able to participate with other kids so you can’t develop the relationships that grow naturally from sharing experiences.You do need help.

Ask if there is a way for you to get transportation to and from.You might also ask the counselor to talk to your dad about reasonable use of the internet. I understand why he is fearful of letting you get on social media. The news is full of reports of negative things that can happen to teens on the air waves. But the internet is here to stay.

            "I am sorry that the system of benefits from the Veterans Administration (VA) hasn’t given you the help you deserve and need. It sounds as if your service has caused a number of severe reactions, including Dissociative Identity disorder (DID). While I’m assuming most of our readers understand the symptoms associated with the other disorders, I am going to focus on the DID since that is the one you are saying the VA will not treat.Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is something diagnosed by a mental health professional, typically a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. There are several symptoms that underlie DID and the primary one is that it disrupts the person’s identity as other “personalities” or personality states manifest. These often include different voices, and in some cultures can even be identified during these states as being possessed.These states disrupt the individual’s identity because there is a gap between one’s sense of self and motivation toward one’s goals with changes in emotional expression, behaviors, memories, feelings, and perceptions. Often these gaps result in memory loss of everyday events, including the specific features of one’s own personality and identity. The role of wife, sister, student, girlfriend, etc., that might make up the individual’s identity are usurped by other, interfering and often competing personalities. These disruptions cause gaps in memory that are beyond what would be considered normal forgetting. These indicators typically cause significant stress in the person’s life because it directly impacts the quality of relationships, and aren’t the result of other medical issues such as seizures.In the past DID was known as (and is still sometimes referred to as) Multiple Personality Disorder. The disorder is a way the psyche tries to deal with trauma or abuse, and the personalities have emerged to help cope with different aspects of life. Very often these personalities are compensatory for something the individual is unable to do in their life. As an example, an unassertive person might form an aggressive or highly assertive personality to compensate.A common symptom is for an individual with DID to lose track of time and there may be significant intervals that are lost due to one of the entities takes control. It is typically not commonly diagnosed in the population, and the best methods of treatment often involve psychotherapy aimed at integrating the identities into the core personality. You can learn more about DID here.Your service to your country was a significant enough sacrifice and finding a way to get treatment for these condition through the VA is the job of a patient advocate.A patient advocate for the VA is a person that will take up your concerns as a VA patient. You have rights that an advocate can intervene on in your behalf. Typically they work with every department involved with the VA and are given the authority to address your needs and issues in a faster manner. They typically get involved when there is a gap between needs and services and are familiar with problems, issues, and complaints such as yours. Typically they are individuals who let you know that once they start working with you — your problem becomes theirs to solve. I’ve located the patient advocate program closest to your geographic area. Here you can find specific names, phone numbers, and emails to contact. I sincerely hope you connect with them so they can help you get the services you need. You deserve them and are entitled to treatment.Wishing you patience and peace, "

            "I’m so glad you wrote. You say you are past the feelings about the divorce and losing friends. But your actions (getting lost in video games or doing nothing) tells me that’s not quite the truth. You’ve suffered a number of important losses this year. You are still grieving the family that you thought you had and the friendships that have collapsed. Although you seem to understand both in your head, your heart hasn’t caught up.First, about the grades: College admission people know that the teen years are often characterized by changes and upheavals. You can’t undo what happened with your grades, it’s true. But you absolutely can do something about what happens next. When admissions people see high grades, then a slump, then high grades, they know that something was up that made the slump happen. In addition, your high school counselor can write a recommendation that includes an explanation for the slump. The most important thing you can do to make yourself competitive again for getting in the school you want is to buckle down and do the very best you can to recoup your grade average. If you folks can’t afford a summer class, that may mean taking a weekend course at a local college or taking extra credits next year. Talk to your guidance counselor about the best approach.One more thing: Please don’t put all your dreams on a particular school. Most schools have a limited number of slots for incoming freshmen. There are many excellent programs for anesthesiology in other schools besides the one  you’ve identified. It’s only wise to research and apply to a number of schools.As for the friendships: Sometimes what people need from relationships as they mature is different from what they needed when younger. Often, younger people make friendships based primarily on proximity. It’s not at all unusual for people to make friends with kids in the neighborhood or kids who sit next to them in class. But that isn’t really a good way to decide who should be an intimate friend.The best way to find like minded people is to join some activity or sport or club or political effort that genuinely interests you and get involved. If you focus on the activity, not the people, relationships will naturally evolve. Doing something important together is one of the best ways to find others who share your passions and values.I wish you well."

He has been feeling suicidal, which he dropped on me as we were walking into my parents house. I was completely caught off guard and said this was a selfish (cringe) time to disclose this information since we are always together. I apologized right after we had dealt with my family and tried to talk but he didn’t want to. He said everything was fine. I offered we go home and he said he wanted to stay. We went out on a boat trip with my family the next day. My boyfriend got really drunk and got into a fight with me because he wanted me to drive him to his friends (we were in the middle of the ocean). I tried hugging him to show I loved him and it was okay and to calm down but that just made it worse. He said I tried to smother him, broke up with me in front of my family, and forced my family to take him to a private beach where he waited for someone to pick him up. Once we both got back home a few days later we tried to talk but he told me that I never supported his mental health. I had no idea he felt this way, that episodes like this were so intense. He told me he had bipolar but he never talked about it. I was really involved in finding him a therapist and I was always there but he would tell me he just “needed to be quiet” and he was “okay.” I’m not sure what to do. He won’t talk to me anymore and has wiped me from his life. This is the total opposite of the person who asked my grandfather (one month ago) for permission to marry me. I’m extremely lost. I have PTSD and so all of this is extremely triggering for me. I’ve been completely open with my mental health and the boundaries I need. I don’t know if I should keep checking on him or leave him alone. I left him alone because he said he wanted space when this first happened but then he threw in my face that i wasn’t there for him when we did talk.",

            "Leave him alone for right now. Regardless of what the diagnosis is for your boyfriend, the timing is too important to ignore. Whether we blame this on his illness, insecurity, nerves, lack of self-confidence, or simply inappropriate behavior your boyfriend sabotaged the relationship as it was on the brink of blossoming. As I see it your boyfriend didn’t break up with you during his episode as much as his episode came during the greatest intimacy of your relationship. He asks permission to marry you, then announces he is feeling suicidal when walking into your parent’s home. You seeing this as selfish is an honest reaction, but it isn’t so much selfish as it is interesting timing, which I think is what you are reacting to.Based on the timing alone I’d say he was having great difficulty in tolerating good things happening in his life with you. This would explain why he moved toward greater intimacy and once it became imminent he found a way to bail. Also, he didn’t take you up on the offer to go home because (my guess) he was determined (at least unconsciously) to sabotage it. Hence the drinking episode and impossible demand for you to follow through on.This isn’t something you can fix or couple therapy can help. Your ex-boyfriend has some major issues in his life that need to be dealt with personally and professionally. They aren’t going to improve with your love and support if they can’t be taken in. As much as these things are necessary for all types of recovery a person must be able to receive them. If he is hell-bent on sabotaging your best efforts at supporting him and greater intimacy—you’ll want to give him a great deal of space—and work on nurturing yourself for now.The find help tab at the top of the page can help you find a therapist in your area.Wishing you patience and peace, "

        "cbt_answer": "I understand how overwhelming and distressing this situation must be for you. It sounds like you've experienced a lot of emotional turmoil and confusion. Let's break it down using the CBT approach:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nFirst, I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you, given your history with PTSD and the added stress of dealing with your partner's sudden disclosure of suicidal feelings. It's natural to feel caught off guard and hurt by his behavior.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nOne key thought here might be, \"If I'm not there for his mental health during his episodes, I'm not a supportive partner.\" Or perhaps you're怀疑 your own ability to handle the situation and provide the support he needs.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nIt's essential to challenge this belief. Can you reflect on the times when you were present for his心理健康, even if he didn't express it then? Did you respect his need for quiet or space, or did you feel blindsided by his lack of communication? Remember, people with mental health issues often struggle to communicate their needs clearly.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nIt might be helpful to have an open and non-judgmental conversation with him soon, but give him some space to process his feelings. Explain that you're here to support him, but you also need to prioritize your well-being. You could suggest he seek professional help for his bipolar disorder, as that can better guide your interactions. Remember, your boundaries are important, and it's okay to set them if he's not respecting them.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nKeep checking in with your well-being and seek support from friends or a therapist if you need it. While it's heart-wrenching to see him go through this, giving him space might allow him to realize the impact of his actions and potentially lead to a healthier resolution. Remember, the healing process takes time, and it's crucial for both of you.\n\nIn the midst of this, it's crucial to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. Don't hesitate to reach out for professional help or to lean on your support system.",

Through my childhood my parents would erupt into major fights that can get physical at any moment.  They are good parents to my brother and I but i’ve never experienced a moment with my parents showing love or affection towards each other.  They separated a lot and for over one year my brother and I had to move from one aunt’s house to the next while both parents were in different countries.",

            "I’m sorry you had such a tough beginning.  Your parents apparently were able to love you and your brother even though they weren’t able to love each other. Sometimes the most loving thing a parent can do for their child is to let someone else care for them while they figure themselves out. I’m guessing that’s why you and your brother stayed with relatives for a while. I hope the aunts were kind to you.You sought safety and security in a long relationship during your teen years. It helped you manage the difficult high school environment and gave you companionship and the love you had been seeking. But like most high school relationships, it came to an end just as high school does. The problem with such relationships is that often the two young people depend too much on each other and they get zero experience with managing the ups and downs of other relationships. So, yes, that relationship gave you safety. But it had a cost. You didn’t have the opportunity to get to know other people and to develop confidence in yourself as a friend and as a partner.Turning to drugs blunted the pain but also deprived you of another opportunity to learn how to relate to others. I take it that you have quit drugs which is terrific. Like many people who have used and abused drugs, getting clean means finally facing what you were avoiding. Now you find yourself in many ways back to age 16 when you were so unsure of yourself.One way to avoid your fear of negative judgment by others is to first judge yourself. You are like a salesman who presents his product by saying, “I know you won’t want to buy this thing I’m showing you.”  It protects him from feeling rejected if people don’t buy because he has already told them that he doesn’t expect them to.  Similarly, you have already decided someone won’t like you so you beat them to it by expecting rejection.You are on an important quest. I hope this idea is helpful to you. If you can’t explore it further on your own, I hope you will consider making an appointment with a mental health counselor to help you delve more deeply into it.I wish you well."

You might try engaging in activities that help you feel more comfortable around others, such as joining clubs or volunteering. Additionally, therapy, especially CBT, could help you understand and challenge your negative thoughts about attachment and relationships.\n\nEncouragement and Foresight: Remember, connections take time and effort.

            "Based on the information presented in your letter, she may be someone who is struggling with self-esteem and needs professional guidance. Her inability to “love herself” may be an expression of depression or of her overall unhappiness in life. It’s common for people with depression to believe that they’re unlovable.It’s also possible that these problems may have originated, at least in part, with her family. Often, people who feel like she does, don’t feel loved or supported by their families, specifically their parents. Poor familial relationships may lead some to feel lost, unloved and depressed.You might have a better understanding of your friend and what she’s experiencing by studying Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. These needs must be fulfilled in order for an individual to be psychologically healthy and satisfied with life. Broadly speaking, it’s a psychological theory that explains what motivates human behavior.At the bottom of the hierarchy are physiological and safety needs. These involve food, water and shelter. These need to be met every day. It would be very difficult to function daily without satisfying these fundamental needs.The next two involve love and belonging, and self-esteem. Love and belonging refers to the idea of needing to feel that someone loves you. Often, this validation comes from one’s parents but it can also come from friends, family or a relationship with a higher power. Once someone knows that they are loved, they feel worthy of being loved. Perhaps if your friend felt loved, she’d find it easier to love herself.A similar thing is true regarding self-esteem. Self-esteem involves the idea of feeling “good enough to be accepted by others.” It’s common for young people to struggle with self-esteem issues often because of their age. Developmentally, young people are largely reliant on others. Self-esteem tends to come with age and independence but it mainly develops as a result of proving competence and doing things that you’re proud of. For instance, earning a college degree, getting a job, being a good parent, and so forth. At some point in one’s life, it will be important to feel validation about one’s abilities. Once that occurs, an individual is no longer driven to fulfill this need. This is not to say that they would stop attempting to accomplish things in life; it’s that they will no longer be driven by the need to prove that they are “good enough.”According to the theory, once all of the aforementioned needs are met, an individual is now ready for self-actualization. Self-actualization is a process of becoming fully who you are, your true self. I don’t have enough column space to describe all of the characteristics of self-actualizing people so I would recommend reading Abraham Maslow’s book about the subject. You should encourage your friend to read it as well.If depression is at the root of her problem, then she should consult a mental health professional. That type of help is beyond what you can provide as a friend. The main job of a caring friend is support and encouragement. Beyond that, there may be little else you can do. Psychological health, growth and development is a very personal matter. Hopefully, she will be open to treatment, should it be necessary. Good luck and please take care."

How has this belief been shaped by past experiences or societal pressures?\" Encourage her to explore this self-doubt and consider if it's a distorted view.\n\n4.

            "While there are many positive qualities of support groups, they are not without their problems. This is especially true regarding online support groups.The benefits of online support groups include finding comfort in knowing that you’re not alone in experiencing a particular problem. It can be good to connect with other people who understand what you’re going through.Online support groups may also provide education and insight into your own situation. You might learn something that could lead to new ideas and treatments.It’s always good to have a supportive network of people in your life, even if only online. People who have good support networks don’t feel alone, and overall have more positive experiences in life.Alternatively, there are drawbacks with online support groups. Unmoderated, some of the group members can devolve into negativity. It is easy to be nasty or offensive to persons with whom you have no chance of having personal contact. Ideally, it would be best if it were supervised by professionals but when it comes to Facebook and other social media sites, that’s not likely to occur. Joining a moderated group with clear-cut guidelines about behavior might help to improve the online support group experience.In addition, unmoderated groups may be apt to share misinformation. The feedback of group members may be anecdotal in nature and thus not based on sound scientific principles. Some information can even be harmful.For instance, NBC recently reported a story about parents of autistic kids sharing misinformation in private Facebook groups. Some of these groups were small, with as few as 10 members, but some were large, with thousands of members.They discovered that some parents used dangerous methods to “heal” their children with autism, a disorder that currently has no cure. These included utilizing chlorine dioxide (orally or via an enema, or in baths). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), indicates that chlorine dioxide is essentially bleach and using such treatments can cause permanent harm to the child, even death. Some parents even posted pictures of themselves forcing their children to ingest chlorine dioxide. It appears that some people were so desperate to help their children that there were willing to engage in harmful and potentially disastrous behavior.It’s not uncommon for people to have experiences like what you’ve described in the online environment. If the group were better moderated, or moderated it all, there would likely be rules about complaining or otherwise creating an atmosphere in which negativity could prosper.To answer your question directly, you are not “crazy” to think that the support group is causing more harm than good. It certainly seems to be. Unfortunately, there’s probably little you can do to change the dynamics of the group. It may be best to avoid it. Thank you for your question. Best of luck to you."

If your parents think that they know what is best for you, don’t believe you can make good decisions, and want to control what you do to live — then it is time to go. It is time for you to make your own mistakes and take more responsibility for your life.Leaving doesn’t have to be brutal. Let them know you agree with them that living at home trying to have your own life isn’t working. Tell them you are going to move out to honor their wishes and take more responsibility. Let them know that although you wish they would have more faith in you — you still love and care for them.Have everything you need ready to go. Don’t make this pronouncement and then try to make a plan. Let them know when you are all ready, that you want to talk with them. It should just be you and not you and your boyfriend. This isn’t about him as much as it is about them controlling you. Tell them you are ready to make your own mistakes and are willing to take the consequences of your actions, but you are not willing to be told how to live your life in exchange for rent.Remember, your parents are doing what they feel is best for you and trying to help. They are looking at your life through their loving lens of protection, but the problem is they are also giving you a clear message that you don’t know what you are doing — and don’t have faith in you that has become unacceptable.Moving out is a big deal and moving in with someone creates different concerns than when you are dating. As difficult as it might be to appreciate, you are not moving out to be with your boyfriend as much as you are moving out to not be controlled by your parents and needing to take more responsibility for your life choices. Your relationship with your boyfriend may or may not work out, but taking better care of yourself independently is something that must continue.My final thoughts about this have to do with your readiness. Do as much as you can to discuss and prepare and save money for this move. Keep talking to your parents and boyfriend and friends.

            "According to the Mayo Clinic, “a personality disorder is a type of mental illness in which you have trouble perceiving and relating to situations and to people — including yourself. There are many specific types of personality disorders. In general, having a personality disorder means you have a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking and behaving no matter what the situation. This leads to significant problems and limitations in relationships, social encounters, work and school.” People don’t always neatly fit into one or another of the personality disorders. Often there is an overlap of symptoms.You tell me that your mother may have narcissistic personality disorder. It sounds to me like your mother also has a sadistic streak. The connection between narcissism and sadistic personality disorder has been explored in the research literature.If a person is sadistic, it means that he or she derives gratification from punishing, harming, or abusing others. Most people don’t purposefully inflict physical and/or emotional pain on others because they have empathy for others (including animals) and a strong sense of morality. Not so the person with sadistic personality disorder.Not everyone with narcissism also shows sadistic tendencies. Most narcissists have an inflated view of themselves, have difficulty getting along with others, and need to feel in control to feel safe. But they don’t  get satisfaction from inflicting pain.Narcissistic and sadistic people generally have low self-esteem. It is thought that both generally are the result of confusing negative to abusive experiences in early childhood that result in inferior feelings. To compensate, the person goes overboard and acts superior. In the case of sadists, one proof of superiority is the ability to inflict pain. It is unknown if there is also a biological factor that contributes to the behavior and thinking of those with personality disorders.Engaging these people in treatment is difficult. From their point of view (since they believe themselves to be superior) any problems in relationships are the fault of the other person in the relationship. Your mother’s response is typical. She thinks what she is doing is funny. She isn’t able to empathize with the pain of the pets. She doesn’t understand why you don’t share her amusement.  But, if by chance, she starts to understand that she has a role in why others are upset with her, there is treatment that has been found to be helpful. Often it includes medication and cognitive behavioral therapy.I wish you well."

            "Thank you for writing. There’s a difference between thoughts that are “racing” and “racing thoughts”. Racing thoughts tend to be repetitive and feel over-whelming. Often they are a sign of acute anxiety or possibly bipolar disorder.Unless you have other symptoms, I think you are someone who runs through all the things he needs to do and think about when you wake up. I have a guess that the reason you feel bad is because you worry that these waking thoughts are abnormal. That isn’t necessarily so.Another possibility is something called “morning anxiety”. Morning anxiety refers to waking up with feelings of stress and worry. It’s usually a reaction to stress. A person with morning anxiety is also likely to have generalized anxiety. If that is the case, it would be helpful for you to see a mental health specialist who can provide you with some coaching and support for managing your stress.Mindfulness techniques are also often helpful. Focus on a word or phrase or feeling and breathe deeply. Another technique is to write things down. By writing, you get the thoughts out of your head and onto paper. Still another technique is to do a mental sort of the thoughts: Discard those that make no sense. Put your attention on the thoughts that do need it.

            "There are at least a couple of layers to this question. Details about your sexual history are no one’s business but yours. You have a history. I’m presuming that he has a history too. It is only necessary to share with each other that you each have a history. If either one of you had a negative experience that will effect your relationship with each other, that does need some talking through. If you contracted a transmittable disease, you are responsible for telling your partner that you are taking the right precautions and/or getting treated for it. And, of course, you do need to talk about protection from an unwanted pregnancy. But beyond that, past encounters are generally private information.Then there is the issue of your lies: Sometimes the unconscious has a way to raise red flags even when a person doesn’t consciously see them. I think you know you aren’t really ready to be talking about marriage. You are only 18. You need more years to mature and to figure out who you are before settling down with anyone., especially at your age. Before making the decision to marry, you need far more contact and time with a boyfriend  than a long distance relationship can allow.I think your unconscious helped you out by letting you violate a primary value held by your guy. On some level you knew lying would be a deal breaker. But instead of breaking up with him, you have made it possible for him to break up with you. Maybe it seemed easier to deal with guilt than to deal with rejecting someone you really do like. Whatever the case, I doubt very much you can fix this. Even if it looks like you do, chances are you will do something else to set a break-up in motion.Trust your inner self. Apologize to the guy. Wish him well. And do the growing up you need to do to be the kind of partner I know you would like to be.I wish you well. "

        "cbt_answer": "Dear Teen,\n\nI can understand how difficult it must be to carry such a secret for so long, and it's great that you've come forward with the truth. Let's explore this situation using the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nFirst, I want to acknowledge your feelings. It takes a lot of courage to confront your past and the impact it had on your relationship. Lying can create a lot of tension and mistrust, and I can imagine it's been quite a burden for both you and your boyfriend.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nOne possible key thought here is that you might believe you had to protect your boyfriend from the truth at first, or that you were scared of the consequences. Or perhaps, you felt it was better to keep things hidden than face his reaction. These thoughts might have led to the decision to lie.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you reflect on why you decided to confess 10%? Did you feel like that was a safer place to start, or do you believe the truth would have been too overwhelming? It might be helpful to explore if there were any underlying reasons for not telling the whole truth.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nTo prevent future lies, it's important to work on trust and open communication. You can start by owning your actions, apologizing for the hurt you caused, and being transparent about any other details that come up. It might be helpful to set boundaries with the truth and practice honesty in a graduated way, starting with what you're comfortable sharing right now.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, the process of rebuilding trust takes time. Be patient with both yourself and your boyfriend. If you need support, consider talking to a therapist or counselor to work through any lingering feelings or insecurities.承诺再也不会说谎是积极的一步，但保持一致性并以行动践行也非常重要。\n\nRemember, change is a journey, and it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight. Keep moving forward and take advantage of this opportunity to strengthen your relationship through honesty and understanding. If you need further support, don't hesitate to seek it.",

        "question": "Hi, first some information to myself. I am a very planning person and hate uncertainty and feel a high degree of responsibility for my family. I also was always afraid of death and therefore also of cancer, heart attacks also. Now I had a panic attack 3 months ago that kicked off thoughts and high fear of suicide. I was so afraid that u went straight to a psychological clinic where I was diagnosed with OCD and a panic disorder. I am lucky, not afraid of driving or knives or anything like that because I really don’t want to die so I don’t think I am a risk for myself. But that now first kicked off the huge fear of a major depression that could change my attitude one day towards the fact that I don’t want to die. Luckily I could also reassure myself that I don’t have depression because I don’t really show any symptoms like listlessness or loss of happiness in activities. I also still see my friends a lot. But I somehow still are very sensitive towards my emotions and anything around me that sound like death depression, sadness, suicide or stuff like that. That stuff scares me. For example, when somebody is making a joke about me I instantly check myself to make sure I am not sad or mad or anything. That goes along with a lot of ruminations about the topics of OCD, suicide, anxiety and psychological disorders itself. I also sometimes have the feeling of derealization when I feel anxious and insecure. And since some days the fear of becoming schizophrenic or psychotic came up heavily. I don’t have any hallucinations or hear anything that isn’t there but the occasional surreal feeling of the world around me freaks me out. I am so scared that I could harm myself in psychosis. I also never took drugs or had any psychological disease in my family. Does that sound to you like an upcoming psychosis or something like that or is it just my OCD that freaks me out?

The sensitivity and rumination can feel overwhelming, but again, I admire your ability to somehow navigate the choppy waters of these indicators.I think it would be in your best interest to begin working with a therapist, a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist in particular, who can help follow the symptoms as they emerge and come to an accurate diagnosis. The clinical psychologist often uses various tests that can help with the diagnosis, which can then pinpoint which treatment is best. Self diagnosis is difficult, and with the information you have presented it would not be possible for me to offer an opinion. Often when the symptoms overlap as yours do, a psychological examination combined with ongoing therapy to track the markers is most helpful.Wishing you patience and peace, "

        "cbt_answer": "Hello and thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences. It's clear that you're going through a challenging time with your anxiety, OCD, and the fear of depression and psychosis. Let's work through this together using a CBT approach:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy: I understand how overwhelming these thoughts and feelings must be, and it's natural to feel responsible for your family and fear for your well-being. It's commendable that you sought help and were diagnosed with OCD and panic disorder.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief: One key thought here is the fear of a major depression turning into a desire to die, due to the initial panic attack. Your sensitivity to certain topics and the worry about your own mental health contribute to this fear. Also, the concern about developing psychosis, despite no actual hallucinations or symptoms, is a distorted belief based on your anxiety.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection: Are these fears based on evidence or just your interpretation? Have you considered speaking with your mental health professionals about your hallucination-like experiences and how they relate to your OCD or anxiety? Are there any patterns or triggers that might be contributing to these sensations?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: To manage these thoughts and feelings, consider practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques to regulate your emotions. When you notice yourself ruminating, try to interrupt the cycle by asking yourself if the worry is evidence-based. Also, consider seeking professional help to address your OCD specifically, as they can provide coping strategies and exposure therapy to reduce your anxiety.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight: Remember, it's important to trust your healthcare providers' diagnosis and not jump to conclusions about potential psychosis. Keep attending your appointments and discussing any concerns you may have. It's possible that with time, therapy, and support, your fears will lessen.\n\nIt's crucial to continue your treatment plan and engage in self-care. Remember, recovery takes time, and setbacks are a normal part of the process. Don't hesitate to reach out for additional support if needed.\n\nBest of luck in your journey towards managing these concerns.",

            "No, you can’t continue to manage this painful situation. Neither can your girlfriend. Her illness has become the most important “person” in your relationship. I’m sure this was not her intention. But she is more involved with her illness than she is with you. Quite inadvertently, and with the best of intentions, you have supported her in being ill by being as scared as she is. Talking with her in detail about her desire to kill herself isn’t helping either one of you.A session of therapy every other week is clearly not enough for this level of distress. I suspect that her therapist doesn’t understand the intensity of your girlfriend’s symptoms or she would have increased the frequency of sessions long ago.My best suggestion is that you join her in her therapy sessions for awhile — or at least for part of her therapy sessions.  If you attend even some part of the sessions, you and the therapist can focus on getting you out of being a crisis worker and back to being a loving support. Ideally, you will change the situation so you are partnering with the side of your girlfriend that wants to be well instead of the side of her that is afraid of change. The therapist can help your girlfriend shift her need for crisis intervention to someone who is trained to manage it. Her therapist, not you, should be assessing her need for an inpatient stay.Your girlfriend doesn’t want to lose you. Using you for daily crisis sessions isn’t the way to “keep” you. I think and hope that if you are clear and loving in insisting that you participate in helping her heal in a useful way by working together in therapy, she will go along. If not, by all means call your local Emergency Services Team to assist you when she talks about suicide.I wish you well."

It's commendable that you took responsibility for the lie and recognized the importance of being open about your depression and seeking professional help. I can see how the fear of criticism and the belief that your mom might misunderstand your feelings may have played a role in your decision to keep this a secret.\n\nFirstly, let's validate your feelings. It's natural to feel ashamed and afraid, especially when you've been taught to handle things differently. It's important to remember that everyone's experiences are unique, and your mom's perspective might not be the same as yours. It's not about making a big deal out of things, but rather about seeking help when you need it, which is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nNow, let's identify the key thought or belief you have about your mom's reaction. You believe she won't understand your situation because she sees you as wanting to play the victim. This thought could be a distorted perception that might be influencing your feelings. To challenge this, ask yourself: Would your mom's past comments change the fact that you need support for your mental health? How might understanding be more beneficial than her reacting in a certain way?\n\nNext, consider a healthy strategy to address this situation. Instead of waiting for the perfect moment, you could plan a conversation where you're prepared to share your experience openly, while also acknowledging her concerns. Be clear about your need for her support and understanding, and explain how seeking help was a positive step for you. Remember to practice active listening and stay calm, as this can minimize the risk of her criticizing you.\n\nIt's essential to understand that changing dynamics in relationships takes time, and it's okay if things don't improve immediately. As you work on this, continue to show her your growth and progress in managing your depression. Let her know that you're committed to improving the relationship, and that you're willing to work on it together.\n\nRemember, seeking help and being honest about your struggles is a crucial part of your healing process. Encourage yourself to keep talking to your mom and maintain open lines of communication, even if it's a gradual process. If needed, consider seeking additional support from a therapist who can guide you through these conversations.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in this journey, and know that you're not alone.

            "You should explore this diagnosis with your therapist and or psychiatrist. They would be in the best position to diagnose whatever may be wrong.One consideration is that the medication itself is causing you to feel the detachment you have described. This is yet another reason why it’s important to report this potential side effect to your treating professionals. A different treatment may be necessary, but without your feedback they wouldn’t know that anything is wrong. The more information your treatment team has about your symptoms, side effects, and so forth, the more they can help you.You mentioned not wanting to tell your therapist about your experiences with detachment. I would strongly advise against that. Your therapist can’t fully help you if they don’t know what’s wrong. They are there to help you but it’s a struggle if you withhold information. Tell your therapist about all of the things you’re feeling. Your withholding of information might be inadvertently negatively impacting your treatment. They need your input.Regarding your family, you may or may not want to tell them. That is a personal decision you’re going to have to make. Understandably, you don’t want them to worry but they probably wouldn’t have the reaction you think they would. Also, they likely can provide you with much-needed support during this difficult time. When you’re struggling, you need as much support as you can get. If they are not aware that anything is wrong, they can’t help you.You may have noticed by now that you seem to have a tendency towards withholding important information in fear of what others will think of you. You seem to be making assumptions about how you believe people will react to certain information. When it comes to treatment, more information is always better. You shouldn’t be withholding information from the very people who are attempting to help you. It hinders their ability to do their work.It’s not outlandish to suggest that the heart of the problem is that you are not forthcoming about your full spectrum of symptoms. This could potentially explain your continued distress. Thus, the solution to this problem may be (at least in part) you being more forthcoming about your symptoms.I understand your frustration with this process but don’t give up. You’re on the right track. You’re in counseling and you trying different types of medication. You doing all the right things. Trial and error are common elements of the treatment process. It can be challenging but it’s well worth the effort. By being more forthcoming about your symptoms, you might find that your treating professionals are better able to assist you. With more information about what’s wrong, they’ll be better equipped to make the proper treatment adjustments. Good luck and please take care."

I don’t know if I am to blame, if there’s things I can do to improve on the relationship other than sit and just avoid any contact with him, which hasn’t worked or just bend to every rule he makes. He has this very aggressive, controlling nature, using respect as a weapon against any lack of discipline towards him.

            "It would be helpful to have an objective evaluation of the situation. You may be right about your father and he might be entirely to blame. It’s also possible that you are contributing to the problems in this relationship, but without an objective third-party assessment it’s difficult to make that determination.One solution to this problem is individual counseling. This would involve you going to see a therapist on your own. Another option is family therapy. If your father is open to it, this might be a good way to sort through these problems. Given how you described your father, he may not be open to family therapy. It wouldn’t hurt to ask. If he’s not open to it, then try individual counseling. Family therapy may be the ideal but individual counseling could help a great deal.The good thing about counseling is that you get to meet with an experienced professional who can provide you with an objective opinion on this matter. The analysis the comes from good psychotherapy can help to clarify your situation. The therapist could also assist you in learning better ways to interact with your father. Clearly, something needs to change but without more information and further analysis, it is unclear as to how to proceed.The bottom line is that this seems to be a power struggle. There are likely other factors involved. Understanding the power dynamics between the two of you will be important in knowing how to move forward.One thing is certain, if you’re living with your father, it may be time to move out. You stated that you “respect his house and his rules to a degree” which made me think that you might still be living in his home. If so, your moving out could significantly improve the dynamics of your relationship. He might gain respect for you if he saw you developing more independence.Also, the fact that you follow his rules only “to a degree” could be part of the problem. It’s not clear what those rules are and if you should be following them entirely or “to a degree.” Again, more information and analysis are necessary.If your father is as controlling and aggressive as you have described him to be, it might be in your best interest to keep your distance. When someone’s unwilling to change, then it is you who must adapt. If your interaction with him is problematic, then it would be wise to limit the time you spend with him.I wish that I had more specific guidance I could offer you but that’s impossible to do over the Internet. There’s a great deal of information that would need to be acquired in order to give you the most appropriate advice. That is why in-person counseling is the ideal solution to this problem. It’s the best way to acquire the necessary guidance for interacting with difficult people. It will also help to resolve the depression you’re feeling as a result of this situation. I hope that you will give it a try. Good luck and please take care."

        "question": "I was married 36 years to my soulmate. Our relationship wasn’t perfect but we were perfect for each other. His death was due to very critical health problems that resulted in 100 days in a hospital that ended with a massive heart attack in the hospital. I was with him when he passed. My concern is where are all the people who were there for me prior? Why do friends stop calling, etc. Prior to all this, I had a fairly good social life. However I always seemed to be the one reaching out, making dinner dates, planning get togethers. I do work full time and was my husbands caregiver for awhile, but I always made sure I made time for my friends. Now that I am alone, nobody ever reaches out, still. You would think they would realize I lost the love of my life and reach out to me. Make sure I am ok, invite me to lunch. I can count on one hand the number of friends who have checked on me. Is losing friends normal during grief? I mean even my husbands old friends, the guy who did the funeral ( a longtime friend), even my husbands family! (out of his 4 siblings, 1 has reached out) I spend a lot of time alone. I work, spend lots of time with my grandkids, but as far as a social life, its almost nothing. Part of me is angry that here I am going thru the worst thing I’ve ever experienced and where are the people who came to the funeral, said they are there for me? Why NOW is it still up to me to be the initiator? I am doing ok with the grieving process and have made great progress in the last 12 months, except for THIS. Even some co-workers ignore the situation, my own boss doesn’t even ask how I am, ever. Not once since the funeral. (I love my job and have been at my job 31 years. This last year has shown me tho, nobody wants to deal with a grieving person) I never imagined friendships would disappear after such a loss.",

            "Part of the problem is that you considered these people friends in the first place. The people who you thought were your friends, were really not. They were friends of convenience, acquaintances.In other words, they were not actually your friends. Friends don’t act the way they have. They are acquaintances. There’s a big difference between acquaintances and friends.An acquaintance is someone you know and spend time with on occasion. They usually don’t know many personal details of your life. Acquaintances are often people you work with, see at the gym and even some family members.A friend is someone with whom you have a strong bond. You often spend a lot of time with your friends. They know intimate details of your life and are people that you can depend on during times of need and distress.Your true friends are the ones you can count on. The ones who checked on your well being after your husbands’ death. Those are your actual friends. It took this tragedy for you to learn to truth about the people in your life.That these “friends” abandoned you when you needed them the most is not uncommon. Research on the subject provides a number of different explanations as to why some people behave in this manner.One explanation is that when someone else is experiencing terror or tragedy in their lives, it hits too close to home. Some people don’t want to be reminded of all the terrible things that can happen in life. By staying away from you and your loss, they don’t have to deal with the fact that bad things happen in life. You might think of it as a denial of sorts.It’s possible that some people cannot tolerate feeling helplessness. In light of not knowing what to do, some people will avoid the situation altogether.Survivors guilt could also be an explanation. They may feel grateful that the tragedy didn’t happen to them but feel ashamed about their reaction during your time of need. Avoidance is an easy way to not have to think about or confront their own shame about their poor handling of the situation.Another explanation involves not knowing what to say or how to react when it comes to death and dying. Some people simply don’t know how to comfort someone else going through a difficult time. They may be concerned about saying something that inadvertently isn’t helpful. For instance, when faced with a tragic situation, it’s typical for people to discuss their own personal situations. They may worry about appearing insensitive, selfish or awkward and thus choose to avoid you.Understandably, you are disappointed. You thought that certain people would behave in certain ways but now realize that your expectations were unrealistic. Your “friends” were doing what many other “friends” have done in situations just like this. It’s not a stretch to suggest that it’s human nature to do what many of these “friends” did to you.The silver lining is that you learned who your true friends are. Cherish those relationships. Those are the individuals who are deserving of your time and energy. Obviously, it would have been better to have known who your true friends were from the start and to have never experienced this disappointment, but at least now you know the truth. It’s always good to know the truth.I’m very sorry for your loss. If you’re struggling, you might consider joining a grief support group. Good luck and please take care."

        "cbt_answer": "I understand how confusing and isolating it must feel to have experienced such a profound loss, and it's natural to feel a mix of emotions, including anger and confusion. Let's examine your thoughts and beliefs about this situation through the lens of CBT, and see how we can address them.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nYou've shared your feelings with grief, the significant role you played as your husband's caregiver, and the unexpected void left by the absence of support from your friends and coworkers. It's crucial to acknowledge that everyone processes grief differently, and some may struggle with finding the right words or actions.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nA potential core belief here could be: \"If I need support, then others should automatically step up, and since they haven't, they don't truly care about me.\" This belief might lead to a sense of entitlement or a misperception that others should be aware and take action.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nIt might be helpful to consider that people may be unsure of how to approach or support someone in such a deeply personal and painful time. They might also be dealing with their own grief or might feel uncomfortable discussing it. Additionally, you've been a supportive presence in their lives, so it's not necessarily a reflection of their value as friends.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nInstead of expecting immediate support, try communicating your needs and boundaries in a gentle but clear way. Share how you're feeling, but also express openness to their support. Consider reaching out to a few close friends and family members to let them know you appreciate their understanding if they haven't been able to act yet. It's also acceptable to ask for help with practical tasks or to simply spend time together.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember that the healing process takes time, and it's okay to take things one day at a time. Don't be too hard on yourself or others. If your boss doesn't reach out, it might be a good opportunity to schedule a brief conversation to discuss how you're doing. You might also consider joining support groups or community events to meet new people and find a sense of connection.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's understandable to feel hurt and disappointed, it's essential to understand that grief can change relationships. Give yourself and others space to navigate their own emotions and experiences. Keep in mind that genuine connections often emerge over time, and your ongoing support for others could lead to deeper relationships in the future.",

            "I’m very glad you wrote. This is a difficult way to live. As much as you say you hate change, you do need to change how you think and feel.Normally, I would refer anyone who is suffering physical pains to their physician. In your case, the pain changes location day to day. That suggests that the “pain” is a way that your body is telling you that something is wrong but that it might not be physical. I’m guessing the body pains are like a “smoke detector” going off, telling you that you are in deep psychological pain that needs to be treated. You should have an exam by a physician just in case there is something medically amiss — just to be on the safe side.I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of only a letter. But your description of your thoughts and feelings does suggest depression and anxiety. Please make an appointment with a mental health professional for an evaluation. Self-diagnosis may be a place to start but once you label yourself, what do you do next? For that you need the expertise of a professional. A counselor will not only evaluate you for a diagnosis but will also make suggestions for what you can do to feel better.Meanwhile, you say you can’t help it that you have low self esteem but that simply isn’t true. Self esteem isn’t something you have or you don’t. It’s a term that describes how people feel about themselves at the time. A positive self esteem can be built by interrupting negative thinking and setting positive thinking in motion. The way to do that is to start doing things that you believe are helpful to others. Doing good is what leads to feeling good. If you wait to feel good before you do good, it won’t work. It goes the other way around. I know. I researched this and wrote a book about it: Unlocking the Secrets of Self-Esteem: A Guide to Building Confidence and Connection One Step at a Time.You made a very important first step toward feeling better by writing to us here. I urge you to take the next step and to make those appointments with a physician and counselor. You don’t have to live with these feelings. With the help and support of professionals — and with commitment on your part to work on it, you can again feel good about yourself and have friends.I wish you well. "

My guess is that she is a terribly hurt person who is lashing out because she doesn’t know any other way to get the attention from your dad she craves. Hurt people generally hurt other people. A starting point for you is to remember that.It’s not true that you didn’t get along as kids because you were raised separately. You didn’t get along because both of you wanted what you thought the other person got. I’m guessing that as a young child, you wished you could be with your mom and siblings. It’s also likely that she thought you had a better life with your aunt than she had.You’ve both had it hard. There is no “winner” in the contest of who had it harder. It sounds like neither one of you had the stability of a loving family that every child needs and deserves. Since she is violent and you have violent fantasies, I’m guessing that both of you grew up in situations where you either experienced or heard about violence. Kids do tend to learn what they live.It’s a shame that the two of you can’t be allies in healing. You don’t need to be competitors. If your dad is a loving father, there is enough love to go around. There is absolutely no need for you to bicker with her. You can’t be your stepmom’s defender. You can’t make your sister be more mature. She’s still working out the pain of her childhood.  If you think your sister is out of line, say it once, and only once. Then let your father and stepmom iron out their issues with her.You could try to talk with her reasonably and rationally. You two were really in the same situation even though you were in different places in your early years. Neither of you had the family you wanted and needed. Together you could restart your relationship by realizing that you could be there for each other now as two people who uniquely understand what it was like. She may not be able to listen but it’s at least worth a try.I do think that you, your sister, and your father and stepmom could benefit from some family therapy. There are a lot of hurt feelings ricocheting around your house. With the help and guidance of a licensed therapist, you could all learn new ways to support each other in healing so your futures can be better than you past.I wish you well. "

Let's work through this together using the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n\n1.

It's okay to feel a bit uncomfortable or overwhelmed, especially if there's a history of conflict.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief: Your thoughts might be, \"These dreams are a reflection of my stepmom and sister's relationship, and it's getting worse because of the change in our family dynamics,\" or \"I'm attracting bad energy because of the history we had as kids.\"\n\n3.

        "question": "Around two years ago I found out that one of my closest friends was being abused by her stepdad. I know he would physically abuse her, and I’m pretty sure he mentally abused her too. She always dismissed it saying that he was drunk, but I could tell she still resented him and was very scared of him. She assured me that he never really hit her anymore but recently she would come to school with cuts on her face. When I asked her about it all she said was that she had been missing school because she was sick and her stepdad hated when she missed school. I was immediately concerned and considered reporting it but I knew my friend was scared that if the abuse was reported that she would get taken away from her mom and have to live with her dad in Florida. She hates her dad so much that she would rather ive with her abusive stapdad and she insist that her real dad is not fit to take care of here. I know she trusts me not to report it and I know if I did she would feel betrayed and would probably never forgive me. I normally would talk to my mom about this whole situation but she is a teacher and therefore is a mandated reporter. I need help deciding what to do. I try to be there for her but I feel horrible letting the abuse happen. should i report it and hope that if she does get removed from the household that she would go live with another family, like her grandparents who live in the same town, or should I just continue to be there for my friend?",

            "Your friend is very lucky to have you. You are thoughtful and caring of her emotions, and this is exactly what she doesn’t have at home. With an abusive stepdad it means she also has to live with a mother who allows is abuse. Your friend has no real support at home because one parent is abusive and the other condones it. Your friendship is an important part of your friend’s ability to see this through. I admire your caring and love for your friend.The best course of action for now is to support your friend and offer to go with her for some help. There is an organization called Alateen that helps teenagers cope with family members who have problems with alcohol. Her acknowledgement that his abuse often occurs after drinking is what qualifies her for this organization and your connection with your friend is enough of a qualification for you to go as well.I’d look up on the internet where there are meetings near you and go together. No one there is mandated to report the abuse. But these groups are typically highly helpful in navigating the feelings that come with an abusive alcoholic parent and a neglectful one. In this way you can help your friend understand three things. First- that you can be there with her as an active source of support. Secondly that she is not alone. Sadly, many other teens have experienced what she is experiencing and they have been able to support and help each other through this 12-step program. Finally, when she is ready to break away from her family and move on to a mentally and physically healthier life there will be guidance.I will also encourage you to call the local woman’s center. You can do it his anonymously to find out what resources they have. Again, sadly, there have been many abused and fearful children of abusive fathers and fearful mothers. They have real experience and counseling and support that can guide you further in helping your friend.Your love and concern is a tribute to your friendship and your own health and well-being is very important. Please be sure when you talk to the woman’s center to express the difficulty behind having to keep your friends secret out of respect for her. This is a real concern for your well-being, and they will have some suggestions for you to take care of yours.Wishing you patience and peace, "

Pose Challenge or Reflection: It's crucial to help her understand that reporting abuse is not about betraying her, but about seeking help and support for her.

Provide Strategy or Insight: Consider having a private conversation with her, where you express your genuine concern and explain the importance of reporting.

            "Thank you for putting forth your question. The most intriguing thing about it is what you haven’t said. There is no mention of your sister-in-law’s interest in you, her life satisfaction with your brother, or any effort at romantic relationships on your part. What you have said seems to have come entirely from your point of view, relating only to your needs, and without reciprocity or validation from her of any kind. There is no mention that “we” are in love, or that there is a joint fascination. The only thing that you’ve identified as the foundation for your feelings is the fact that you used to be friends. Specifically missing in that underpinning is any kind of romantic attraction that is shared.What you have said is that because of this friendship more than 15 years ago “I was robbed of a wife and robbed of a life.” That doesn’t sound like what happened at all. It may, indeed, be what you feel, but did your brother steal her from you? It doesn’t sound that way. It sounds like you didn’t make your feelings known, and that if you did your sister-in-law didn’t respond. Either way, she has chosen your brother, and it doesn’t sound from your email that she has chosen him over you. While that might be upsetting it doesn’t add up to you being robbed of a wife and a life. In fact, saying that may be the very reason you are not moving forward.She was never “yours” in any way, shape, or form to begin with. How can you be robbed of something you don’t have? Your brother has won the girl of your dreams and so there is nothing left for you to do but pine over it, be angry, upset, and confused. Staying stuck and wishing things were different—particularly since you are saying that it is only you that is in love with her. Never once in your email do you say “we” are madly in love. This is one-sided. Otherwise, you would be talking about this as a joint complication between the two of you. Instead, you are talking about it as a highly personal internal struggle. You thoughts operate more like a fantasy than a complicated love interest.Finally, you say that you are not a jealous person. The typical definition of ‘jealous’ is feeling or showing envy because of what someone else has. This is exactly what you are saying. You wish you had the relationship with your sister-in-law that your brother has. This is jealousy.Pining over unrequited love is classically human and is as old as the species. But from everything you’ve said this feeling of being stuck may not have to do with a fantasy of what you wanted. The reason it doesn’t get better is that you are confronting these feelings in a vacuum. Otherwise, you would be talking about how the two of you are going to figure out your love interest in each other.There isn’t enough information in your email to offer more than this, except that in most instances my experience has been that yearning for the one that got away is often a way not to invest in other relationships. I don’t know if that is the case here, but I’d recommend individual therapy to start unraveling the knot that has kept you aching for this relationship to happen, particularly when it hasn’t had much else but a friendship beneath it.Wishing you patience and peace, "

It's a very complex and sensitive issue that requires empathy and understanding. Let's explore your thoughts and feelings together, using the structure of CBT.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nFirst and foremost, I want you to know that it's completely normal to feel a range of emotions in such a complex love triangle. It's essential to acknowledge these feelings without judging them. You've been trying to suppress this for a long time, and that's a commendable effort to protect your relationship with your brother.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nOne key thought that stands out is the belief that you \"should\" or \"aren't\" allowed to feel this way due to the implications on your brother's marriage. This core belief might be causing you to hold back from expressing your feelings and seeking resolution. It's also the thought that your love is \"complicated\" and somehow wrong.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you imagine if your brother were in your shoes? How would you feel if you found out about his friend's feelings for your partner? Additionally, has trying to bury these emotions led to any unproductive patterns in your behavior or relationships with others?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nA healthier approach might be to have a heart-to-heart conversation with your brother about your feelings, but understand that this could be challenging given the dynamics. It's crucial to respect their marriage and prioritize their well-being. You could also consider seeking therapy for yourself to work through the emotions and find healthier ways to cope.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, it's not about possession or wanting to harm your brother's marriage. Your love is a personal choice, and while it may not lead to a resolution, it's still important to honor your own emotions and work on managing them. If needed, consider joining a support group or seeking professional counseling to help you navigate these feelings in a healthier way.\n\nRemember, healing takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Keep in mind that the goal is not to change your feelings but to find a way to live with them in a way that doesn't harm those around you. I hope this provides some guidance, and please don't hesitate to seek further support when you need it.",

Perhaps that is what you meant when you said that you “keep jumping in the ring for more punches.” That is self-destructive.The famous Einstein quote seems applicable here: “insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”There’s also another quote that is applicable here: “when someone shows you who they are, believe them.”Your sister and mother do things in a particular way, and it seems they’re not going to change. You are the one who does not seem to be accepting of their ways. It’s a shame that things are the way they are and that your mother isn’t more equal in her treatment of you and your sister, but you have no power to change that. You’ve tried and it hasn’t worked. It’s time to give up on the idea that something will change with them and accept it.Understandably, this is a difficult reality to accept because it’s unpleasant. It’s proof positive that your mother and sister may not be the people you wanted them to be, expected them to be or wished they would be. The reality is you don’t have the power to change who they are. You have to accept who they are and adapt accordingly.As they say, “you can’t choose your family” but you can and should learn to adapt to who they are and how they treat you. Treat them how they treat you. Don’t be willing to do more for them than they are willing to do for you.You don’t have to like how they treat you nor do you have to tolerate it. If being around them is unpleasant, then I would suggest limiting the time you spend with them.For example, you invited your sister to Thanksgiving and she didn’t come. Maybe next year don’t invite her.It would also be best if you developed friendships outside the family with people who want to spend time with you and who will not give you excuses about why they can’t do certain things. Be around people who want to be around you.Finally, don’t take how your family treats you personally. I understand that is easier said than done but their behavior likely has nothing to do with you. The way they treat you (and everyone else) is wholly about their personality and personal life philosophy. It is not a reflection of you or your children, in any way.Find other friends and don’t keep “jumping in the ring for more punches.” It is unproductive to purposely put yourself in a situation that you know is going to end badly. If you need more hands-on assistance with how to better manage your family, consult an in-person therapist. That would help immensely. Please take care."

Let's explore this situation using CBT techniques.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nYou feel hurt and disheartened by the unequal treatment and lack of involvement from your mom. It's okay to feel this way, and I can see how it might be causing you stress and sadness.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nA potential thought here might be, \"My mom should treat all her grandchildren equally because I love them all equally and my sister does too.\" This belief might lead to feelings of injustice and resentment.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nIt's important to question whether this belief is entirely accurate. Have you considered the possibility that your mom has her reasons for prioritizing your sister's grandkids, perhaps due to distance or personal preferences? Or, is it possible that her actions are not a reflection of her love for your kids?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nOne strategy could be to have an open and honest conversation with your mom, expressing your feelings and concerns in a non-confrontational way. Use \"I\" statements to avoid putting blame, like, \"I feel hurt when I see more attention given to [sister's grandkids]. It makes me feel [emotion]. Could we talk about how we can ensure a more balanced involvement for all the grandchildren?\" It might also be helpful to involve your sister in this conversation to show a united front.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, change takes time, and it's not up to you to make your mom change. While you can't control her actions, you can control your reactions. If the situation persists, it might be necessary to set boundaries for yourself and your kids, and focus on maintaining positive relationships with those who appreciate your efforts. Additionally, it's crucial to prioritize your own well-being and not let this continue to bring you down.\n\nRemember, your love and commitment to your children are not tied to your mother's actions. Keep doing what you know is best for your family, and seek support from your sister or other trusted sources if needed.",

            "When someone’s personality and behavior change markedly for no apparent reason, the first thing to do is to schedule a visit with her doctor. At 38, she is probably too young for a diagnosis of the onset of dementia — even though some of the behaviors you describe could indicate that. But there are a number of other medical reasons that can result in this kind of change.Your dad should be taking the lead in this, not you. She is unlikely to listen to you since, in her eyes, you are just a kid. But your dad can probably persuade her that something isn’t right and that she should get checked out.If all is well physically, your dad should talk to her about seeing a mental health counselor for an evaluation. The behavior with the dog and her efforts to be more like you are concerning. Sometimes this kind of behavior is a “regression”, a defense mechanism where the person retreats to a time when they felt safer. Often it is triggered by some fear or anxiety or stress that they feel is too hard to handle. The person then adopts behaviors that are typical of a person in an earlier stage of development. The treatment for that is psychotherapy to deal with whatever stressor is at the root of your mom’s distress.I hope your dad and other adults in the family can get your mother to agree to an evaluation. It is unlikely that she will get back to “herself” on her own. She needs the support of professionals. You, your dad, and other people who love her need to better understand how to help her.I wish you well."

It's important to remember that change, especially as people navigate life transitions, can sometimes lead to different expressions or coping mechanisms. Let's explore this through the lens of CBT:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nIt's completely normal to feel concerned when your mom's behavior seems out of the norm, given her age and life experiences. It's important for you to recognize that your feelings are valid, and it's natural to want to protect and care for her.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nOne potential thought or belief here might be: \"My mom's behavior is a sign of a deeper issue or she's regressing because of her own unresolved childhood trauma.\" This belief could lead to worry and anxiety.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nTo challenge this thought, ask yourself: \"Is there evidence that her behavior is a sign of a significant problem, or could it just be a change in perspective or a way to cope with stress?\" Have you considered that maybe she's simply enjoying her childhood-like moments as a way to recharge or find joy?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nEncourage open communication with her. Share your observations and feelings, but try not to judge or criticize. Approach the conversation in a non-judgmental way, and ask her directly if she's comfortable talking about her feelings or if there's anything from her past that's affecting her.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember that small changes in behavior can be normal at any age. If this continues, it's essential to have a supportive conversation with her about professional help if needed. However, give her time and space to process her feelings and let her know that you're there for her.\n\nRemember, your role is to be a supportive and caring listener, and that's an invaluable part of being a good caregiver.

            "Thank you for writing. Here’s the truth: If you don’t trust your therapist enough to tell her what is troubling you, your therapy will not be successful. The “safe” way to tell your therapist is to start with a discussion about your level of trust for the therapist and the therapeutic process. Trust does take time. It takes being honest. It takes venturing into areas that are anxiety provoking to see how the therapist handles them and then talking about any worries you have about what happened.Over time, you and the therapist will build a relationship where you feel free to talk about your history and anything that is upsetting you. Your therapist will help you deal with your concerns. Most important, therapy will become a “laboratory” for discussing how trust issues impact other areas of your life. With support, you will be able to have more honest and richer relationships with other people in your life as well.As far as your apparent symptoms of ASPD: A credible therapist will help you feel safe when you talk about things that might be shocking or upsetting to other people. An experienced therapist has heard such stories before and knows how to handle the subjects with respect and compassion. It’s the therapist’s job to help the two of you make an environment where sessions feel safe. If you can’t develop enough trust with your therapist to share such things, it may mean that you need another therapist.On the other hand, (this is very important) since you also have a diagnosis of BPD, be careful about fleeing a therapist when things get difficult.As you know, BPD is characterized by unstable relationships. Often people with that diagnosis can’t tolerate conflict so they find a way to minimize the importance of the relationship or to fault the other person to justify leaving. Often they form a harsh criticism of the other person while being blind to the  ways that they themselves may have damaged the relationship. The challenge is to both think about your own part in a conflict and to find ways to have a constructive conversation with the other. When that kind of conversation happens, relationships not only stay but also grow.Staying in therapy when your relationship with the therapist is challenged may be one of the most important things you can do. An important part of your healing is to resist your instinct to write someone off or to leave and instead to talk it out. Working through conflict with the therapist can be a powerful and positive rehearsal for doing so with others.I wish you well. "

It's important to feel safe and supported in your therapeutic relationship. Let's address each part of your concern step by step, using CBT principles:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it's natural to feel unsure about how your therapist will react. You're experiencing a lot, and it's crucial to have someone who can validate your feelings and provide a non-judgmental space. Remember, therapists are trained to handle a variety of challenges, and it's possible that your symptoms may be seen as part of your personality disorder.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nYour concern about your therapist not believing you or the fear of being misunderstood arises from a core belief that your ASPD symptoms might be dismissed or not fully acknowledged. This belief could be causing anxiety about opening up about these aspects of yourself.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you consider that your therapist might have encountered similar cases and be knowledgeable about the co-occurrence of ASPD and BPD? They may have tools or techniques to handle complex cases. Think about how discussing these issues could potentially lead to a better understanding of your experiences and the possibility for more tailored treatment.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nInstead of dwelling on what your therapist might think, focus on the potential benefits of sharing. Explaining your struggles with honesty may help you gain insight into your behaviors and emotions, which can contribute to your overall treatment plan. You might also consider asking your therapist about their approach to working with ASPD and any resources they have available.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nIt's okay to take things at your own pace. If you feel ready, start by expressing your concern in a non-accusatory way, and share your understanding of your ASPD symptoms. Your therapist's response can be a starting point for further discussion. Remember, therapy is a collaborative process, and your therapist's goal is to help you.\n\nRemember, seeking help is a strength, and it's important to trust that your therapist is there to support you.

The list of behaviors that you are talking about could match a number of traits and conditions — not exclusively narcissistic ones, but I can certainly see why you would ask. The self-absorption sounds like it would be challenging to be around.However, I think there is something even more important about whatever it is that we would label these behaviors. There is a common thread to most of them that we would be skipping over to get to this label that I think are even more important: Your disappointment and frustration.What comes screaming out of this list is that eight out of the ten sound like they have been directly painful to you. While five and six, faking another mental illness, and taking a position of high responsibility have less to do with harming you, they also show traits of someone who cannot make the connection to you that you need in a relationship. This is more important than whatever label we use for the collection of traits.The deeper question is what you would do if you got confirm these traits were narcissistic? Would you stop your involvement, confront the person, or just continue knowing you had a diagnosis? Diagnostic labels are only helpful if they can offer tools for change. What would you do if this person could be labeled narcissistic?For you to have written your email to us and looking for a label means that the discomfort has reached a level that can no longer be avoided. Use your own disappointment as the motivation for change — not what the collection of traits can be called, but what they are doing to you.I am not encouraging you to blame this person, but rather I am supporting you in making a decision based on what you are feeling, not on what the other person might be regarded as. If I could sum this up into two words, they would be for you to trust yourself. Decide if this relationship is good for your mental health and well-being and follow through based on your answer.Wishing you patience and peace, "

            "It’s not at all unusual for people who are related to have difficulty working together, especially when one is the “boss” of the other. A work relationship and a personal relationship are different. It’s hard for both parties to keep boundaries between the two roles clear. It is often difficult for the employee to voice any negative feelings about the work environment due to a combination of respect and fear they’ll be fired. It’s hard for the boss to treat the relative the same way he or she treats every other employee. Sometimes they err on the side of being too harsh or too lenient.  It is indeed possible that your mother-in-law loves you but didn’t love the way you were doing your job. It’s at least something to consider.From what you wrote to us, it sounds to me like you made a serious error in judgment by writing your thoughts in a blog that was somewhat public. You don’t mention whether you tried to have reasonable discussions with her about the work relationship. You didn’t talk about whether the job itself was a good match for you or whether you kind of fell into working with your mother-in-law, instead of looking for something else. You make no mention of what you might have contributed to the problem.I have to wonder: What was the point of blogging your negative feelings instead of talking adult to adult with her? Were you trying to get “even” with your mother-in-law for how you think she treated you? Were you trying to tarnish her reputation with others? Whatever the case, of course she had a negative reaction!Your husband is in an impossible position: He is caught between his love and loyalty to you and his love for his family. He can’t take “sides” without losing someone important to him. To ask him to “cut ties” with the family he loves is immature and self-defeating. Your husband tries to manage his dilemma by both telling you he agrees with you but still seeing him family. This isn’t working for anyone and is bound to blow up.The person in the best position to change the situation is you. If you love your husband as you say you do, it’s up to you to get him out of the middle and to do your best to heal things. You do owe your mother-in-law a genuine apology for acting out as you did. She was the boss. You were her employee. If you didn’t like how she did her job, you were free to leave. There was no one making you stay if you felt disrespected. Do think hard about what you might have contributed to the situation and what you might have done differently. Knowing that will help you deal with other problematic relationships more successfully.So – Go to see her. Acknowledge that your comments came from frustration and your difficulty with being both an employee and a member of the family. Own your part in the problems. Do not tell her she should be a different kind of boss than she is. It won’t work. She’s lived a long time being who she is. You can’t change her and it is unreasonable for you to expect that you can. Take your lumps. Since you have been trying to cut her son out of her life, she may not take your apology gracefully at first. But if you don’t blame or shame her and talk to her politely she may come around.Then do your best to resume being part of the family. Attend family events with your husband. Invite your in-laws over. Be a grown up about it and eventually it won’t feel like an act. If you can’t figure out how to manage this on your own, I encourage you to find a therapist who can talk it through with you and provide some support while you shift your relationships in this family.I wish you well.

It’s a red flag that should not be ignored.According to the National Institute of Mental Health, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. In 2017, nearly 47,000 people in the United States ended their own lives. Often people consider suicide when they are unhappy or don’t know how to make positive changes in their lives. Suicidal people often develop a tunnel vision that focuses exclusively on negativity. This is why consulting a mental health professional is essential, to assist you in seeing the objective reality. There are a broad range of options available to you to remedy this problem.I would encourage you to read about people who have attempted suicide and who have survived. Consider the story of Kevin Hines. Mr. Hines attempted suicide by jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge. He was in a miserable state of mind. He believed that his life couldn’t change. He thought suicide was his only option. He writes about having regretted his decision to jump the moment his fingertips left the rails of the bridge. He instantaneously knew that he had made a mistake. Fortunately, he lived to tell that story and now imparts his wisdom to others. He lived to see that life can change for the better, with treatment. His story is hopeful, uplifting and demonstrates the will to live that exists in all of us.There are many others like him, too. You can learn about some of their stories by reading this article in The New York Times titled The Urge to End It All.I would also recommend this story about Marsha Linehan, an expert in mental illness who also struggled with suicidal ideation. Reading about their “lived experiences” can help to change your view on life.By reading the aforementioned stories, you’ll hopefully understand that people who are suicidal really don’t want to die. They wanted their pain to end and falsely believed that suicide was a way out. It is not. Getting help is the answer. Whatever might be wrong, is correctable with treatment.Studies indicate that there are millions of people suffering who have never sought professional help. Essentially, that means there are millions of people who are suffering with treatable problems. There’s no reason to suffer with treatable problems when help is available.Contact your primary care physician or mental health professional and ask for their assistance. They will know how to help you. Call emergency services if you cannot protect yourself or believe that you might harm yourself. Good luck and please take care."

        "cbt_answer": "I understand how distressing these thoughts must be for you, and I'd like to validate your feelings and assure you that it's completely normal to experience such thoughts in times of stress or emotional turmoil. It sounds like you might be experiencing intrusive and自动化的消极想法, which are common in anxiety and depression. Let's explore this further.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy: It's okay to feel overwhelmed and concerned about these thoughts. They can create a lot of anxiety and fear, and it's understandable to wonder if you're the only one experiencing them.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief: The central belief here seems to be that you want these negative events to happen, and you feel both motivation and lack of means. It's important to recognize that these thoughts don't necessarily reflect reality and can be distorted by anxiety. You might be perceiving danger where there isn't, or you might be attributing more severity to your thoughts than they deserve.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection: Can you consider why you might feel this way? Are there underlying fears or life circumstances contributing to these thoughts? Are there any coping mechanisms you've tried in the past that didn't work as well as you'd hoped?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: To manage these thoughts, it might be helpful to practice mindfulness or cognitive restructuring. When these thoughts arise, try to acknowledge them without judgment, and then challenge their validity. For example, ask yourself if there's evidence that your fears are actually real. You could also try breaking your thoughts into smaller, more manageable parts and find ways to cope with specific situations that trigger them.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight: It's great that you recognize the potential harm in these thoughts and understand that seeking professional help is needed. Consider talking to a therapist or a mental health provider who can help you develop coping strategies and address the underlying issues. Remember, seeking help is a strength, not a weakness.\n\nRemember, healing takes time, and it's okay to seek support as you navigate these thoughts. With patience and consistent effort, you can work towards reducing their frequency and finding healthier ways to cope.",

            "If you were manipulated out of signing the deed for a home you paid for, it seems to me that it would be helpful to see a lawyer who specializes in disability law. You are essentially being held hostage in your own home. It’s your house. She doesn’t get to set house rules for a 26-year-old man who is letting her share his home. She doesn’t get to decide whether you can drive a car you paid for. Being disabled doesn’t mean that you don’t have the same rights as any other adult.Taking all you said at face value: It looks to me that your mother is, in fact, the dependent one. If you assert your rights to your home, where is she going to go? One way to keep her home is to make sure you don’t meet someone to marry. If you go places without her, you just might meet someone to love. She would then have competition for your affection and for your loyalty.At this point, the problem isn’t your mother. It’s that you have given her far too much power. Her threats and rules only mean something if you go along with them. You’ve been so beaten down that you have lost the ability to stand up for yourself. If that’s the case, find a lawyer. Then find a therapist to help you learn how to assert some boundaries with your mother.On the other hand: I don’t have enough information to know if just maybe your mother’s worries are warranted. You didn’t share whether you have done things that make her behavior make a kind of sense. What looks like control could be protection. If you’ve behaved in such a way that she is justified in thinking you aren’t capable of managing a house or driving responsibly, that changes everything. In that case, my best suggestion is that you go together to a family therapist to help the two of you figure out what you need to do so that she feels comfortable with letting go.I wish you well. "

        "cbt_answer": "I understand how difficult it must be for you to feel trapped and controlled in this situation, given your challenges with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. It's natural to feel frustrated and vulnerable when someone you rely on, like your mother, is exerting so much control. Let's start by validating your feelings and empathy for the situation you're in:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy: It sounds like you're going through a lot, both physically and emotionally. It's tough to cope with these challenges when you feel like your autonomy is being restricted. I can imagine how this lack of independence must cause additional stress and anxiety.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief: It seems you may be internalizing a core belief that your mother's actions are justified because of your disabilities, and that she has a right to control everything due to your dependence on her. This belief might be fueling your sense of helplessness and trappedness.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection: Can you think about any specific instances where her control feels unreasonable or when you've tried to assert your independence? Reflect on if there are alternative explanations or if her actions are causing more harm than good.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: One approach might be to have a calm and non-confrontational conversation with your mother, expressing your feelings and needs. Explain that while you appreciate her care, you need more independence to manage your own well-being. It might also be helpful to involve a neutral third party, like a therapist or a family counselor, to facilitate the discussion.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight: Remember, change takes time, and it might not happen overnight. Be patient with yourself and your mother as she may need time to understand and adjust. Keep practicing self-care and coping mechanisms for your mental health, and continue to advocate for your rights and well-being. If the situation persists, consider seeking legal or professional support to protect your rights.\n\nRemember, the goal is not to blame or argue, but to work together to find a balance that allows you to maintain your independence while still receiving the necessary care.",

        "question": "I was fine until 7th grade ended, and then its like my memory jump skips to constantly being worried and miserable. When I was going through 8th grade I reached a point were I decided to work on what was bothering me so I could be better, but thats when I realized I had no idea what was bothering me. Looking back before all of this started though I’m not sure if I ever was fine, when I was younger I never considered any other kids to be my friend really, a lot of adults though. I did eventually move to a place were I kinda grew comfortable with everyone, and while I used to consider that time to be the peak of my life, looking back there were still flags then to. Im not exactly sure when, but between 2nd and 5th grade I developed maladaptive daydreaming, and while I felt fine for some reason little me felt compelled to feel emotional pain, I used to purposefully seek out depressing content to put myself in a bad mood, I honestly still kind of do this. During this time I developed a crush in which I became obsessively and honestly kind of creepily attached to him which drove him away from me in the long run,(this repeated in 7th). Anyways after 5th grade I moved away from that place to somewhere else, I got adjusted and made new friends and everything seemed fine until 7th grade ended. Going into 8th I originally had hope, I hoped I go back and I’d fall back into the old groove of things and everything would be fine, but when I got back it was just more issues. I didn’t trust anyone, every time I was with my friends I just felt alone, and I figured they probably wanted me gone so they could actually have a good time. My anxiety, (that was previously nonexistent), was at its peak, i’d have shooting pains, hypnic jerks, and would frequently fall into states of depersonalization/derealization. I finally came to the conclusion that the way to stop hurting, was to stop caring. I’d repeatedly tell myself, “I don’t care about anything, I don’t care about anyone”, in hopes that I would believe it, I’m not sure if that had any effect on me, but after 8th grade ended I just stopped caring. I still had symptoms of anxiety and depression, but they were no longer manifesting themselves into physical symptoms. I still felt unwanted by my group of friends so I just stopped hanging out with them. I wouldn’t say I felt happy, but I wasn’t miserable, I was just kind of done I think. Going into high school I still didn’t really have any friends because I was to scared to talk to anyone, and when they made an effort to talk to me, all I could think in response to there advances were one word answers. I started to grow more fearful of the future as I realized that my childhood was running out and I had no idea what I want to do with my life. I know people say “pursue a career in your interests” but nothing interests me. If I could truly do anything in life, I’d find a secluded area from everyone so I could listen to music and be alone to my fantasy world. I guess that’s kind of were i am now, done, and fearful of the future. I can recognize that not all my thoughts are correct and 90% of the bad things that im convinced everyone feels about me, are probably caused by my anxiety, but even being actively aware of that I still don’t feel any different. I just hope that someday I can be normal, I fear that all I’ll have to remember my teenage years, is me sitting alone in my room listening to music. I wish I could go to social outings and take risks, and have new experiences, and I realize for that to happen I have to take the initiative, but everytime I get handed a chance to do those things I shy away from them because in the moment that all sounds like a terrible idea to me because I much rather be left alone, and its not until later that I regret it. A part of me wonders if this all karma, and I’m actually a bad person, or a narcissist thats suffering the consequences of her actions.",

            "There are other certainties in life besides death and taxes. Chief among them is emotional pain. No matter how charmed a life anyone leads, suffering is inevitable from time to time. We should expect it and develop the tools to endure it. It also helps to have a supportive group of people in your life who can serve as a buffer for the more difficult times.The teenage years are especially difficult. You’re experiencing that now. Ask virtually anyone about their teenage years and invariably, unless their memory is faulty, they’ll be able to relate to what you’re going through. There were many ups and downs in life.You mentioned feeling bad about yourself because you don’t know what you want to do with your life. It’s impossible to know what you want to do with the rest of your life at such a young age. It takes a great deal of time, exploration and effort to know what you want to do. At your age, it’s unrealistic to think that you should know how you want to occupationally spend the next half-century or longer. You’re too young to make such a major decision. Take the pressure off.You should try many things. You should read up on many things. You should explore many ideas. Job shadow people who are working in careers that you think would be interesting. Be open-minded and never think that you’re supposed to know things before you’re ready.You should consider discussing these matters with the school guidance counselor. Vocational tests can help to narrow down your interests.You may not know what you want to do with the rest of your life for a while and that’s okay. It’s perfectly acceptable and normal. Take your time, do your research and don’t make a decision prematurely. Most college students change their majors, often dramatically so.I have worked with people who didn’t think too much about what they wanted to do for their careers and simply chose based on what their parents wanted or what they thought they should do. These individuals were often miserable in life because of this.I see a similar thing occurring among students. They chose a major prematurely because they felt pressured to choose because our culture suggests you “should” know. Sometimes, even when they realize they’ve chosen the wrong major, they stick with it because in their minds, it’s too late to start over. Then they graduate with a degree in a field that they have no interest in and now they’re stuck. It would have been far better for them to have taken their time and explored all areas and only had made a choice when they were ready. Few things are more important than choosing your career. Take your time and don’t feel pressure to decide prematurely.You mentioned anxiety. Anxiety is a highly treatable condition. I would strongly urge you to contact an in-person therapist. All of the issues that you have described in your letter are amenable to counseling. It could make all the difference. Give it a try. Good luck and please take care."

It's commendable that you recognized the need to work on your issues and tried to address them. CBT can help here by identifying and challenging some of the thoughts and beliefs that might be contributing to your current feelings.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nI can see how you've experienced a lot of change and uncertainty, and it's normal to feel worried and unsure after going through periods of distress. It's okay to acknowledge your feelings and the impact they've had on your life.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nOne key thought or belief you might have is that by not caring, you're protecting yourself from pain. However, this could also be a way of avoiding responsibility and the possibility of deeper connections. You might also believe that your past behaviors and anxiety make you unworthy of friendships or a normal life.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nIs it really true that you don't care about anything? Or that your fear of rejection stops you from trying? Are your negative thoughts about yourself based on your experiences or is there evidence to support them? Consider the possibility that your anxiety may be influencing how you perceive situations.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nInstead of focusing on not caring, try practicing self-compassion and mindfulness. Recognize that it's okay to feel anxious or uncertain, but also that you can learn to manage those feelings. Gradually, work on building trust and openness with others, and don't be too hard on yourself if you make mistakes or feel overwhelmed.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nIt's okay to take things slowly and seek support as you navigate through this. Consider talking to a counselor or therapist who can help you develop coping mechanisms and work through your fears. Remember, change takes time, and it's possible to break free from your patterns and find a more balanced way of life.\n\nRemember that it's not karma or a reflection of your character. You're going through a difficult time, and it's a normal part of life. Keep working on yourself, and with time, you'll find the courage to take those social outings and explore new experiences.",

I’m interested in what people do with what genetics, environment, and experience has given them. You have many gifts: You are passionate about things. You are not afraid to see things that need improvement and you have many ideas about what to do about them. You have the intelligence to be a top student. You are able to be convincing with other people.It’s not what traits you inherit that matters, it’s what you decide to do with them. There are politicians who use such traits to enrich themselves and manipulate other people to help them do so. There are people with the same skills who serve those who elected them and who facilitate groups of people to right wrongs and to make the world a better place. It’s up to each of us to decide how we will best use our talents and traits. No one else can decide that for us.You can decide to feed your ego by ignoring your own faults. You can deal with your insecurities (and, yes, you do have them) by telling yourself that you are superior. But ultimately, you will find that posturing to yourself and others like that won’t work. You will always question whether you are in fact worthy of others’ high regard or if it’s all a sham.Genuine self-esteem comes from making a genuine contribution. Feeling good comes from doing good, nothing else. Take a long hard look at yourself and decide how you want to live your life.I wish you well. "

You're brave for being honest about this, and it takes courage to question your own beliefs. It's okay to feel disgusted and uncertain.\n\n2.

Are there specific instances that led you to believe this, or is it a general assumption based on your observations? Do you think other family members or individuals from similar backgrounds have successfully navigated these dynamics without struggling?\n\n4.

            "While it is not uncommon for people to question their decisions concerning their love-life, it becomes a powerful source of anxiety when the decision is set to change your life permanently. Your engagement seems to have put this issue front and center. When people come to this kind of a crossroad, it is important to look at it from many directions to understand what is happening. I am glad you are reaching out to us to investigate your thought process.At the core of this dilemma is the fact that you are not fully committed to your fiancé. If the relationship was solid and there were no doubts about it; you would not be drawn to the old friend. Being drawn to someone else at the time of commitment is a very human problem, but the question is why? Whatever the reasons turn out to be there is a core truth, that your commitment isn’t what it needs to be, that must be acknowledged to understand the best way forward. There are several possibilities. I’ll highlight three:Whatever the reason the level of obligation needed to make a life-long dedication isn’t in place. That may be why we have engagements — to test out the idea. There are several factors that you haven’t said in your email that might give you more clues about what is happening and what to do. The first is to know if your old-time friend has any interest, or if this is something that is going on in your mind that he isn’t fully interested in pursuing. It may also be an indication that you and your fiancé may have some issues that need to be talked about. The issues may not have reached the surface fully and can be showing up by you being distracted by your old friend.I will encourage you to reflect on the situation and try to discern what is driving it. Once you do then you will be in a better position to make a decision and take action.However, if it is unclear to you what your feelings are you may want to make an appointment with a therapist. Your fiancé deserves to have a partner that is into the marriage as much as he is. If the situation becomes more difficult I’d recommend couples counseling to allow your concerns to be managed with a professional present so both of your needs will be represented.The most important thing to take away from my response is not to ignore what you are feeling. It could be a distraction, a clarification, a true love, or a test — but whatever it is you need to give it your attention so you can make the best decision for yourself and your fiancé.Wishing you patience and peace, "

I have a clear and unambiguous approach I will share, but it is highly biased and based on my experience. Please get some other opinions and choose the one that best suits your needs and personality. This suggestion and perspective may just not be for you.There are three important clues in your story that lends themselves toward my suggestion. The first is the why is called positive deviance. Of all the ongoing belligerence by this person the one clear thing that worked and worked extremely well was when you stood up to her. You met fire with fire, and she stopped. This is an important clue about how to go forward.Secondly, you mention that you have tried to be rational and that this has not affected you, but then explain how it has directly affected your depressive reaction and ability to concentrate. What I’m suggesting here is that a rational approach doesn’t work. In fact, I’ll go further in saying that this approach is actually part of what is making the problem worse.Finally, you say that you are being falsely blamed and are victimized by her rage. Accepting this in any form only allows it to continue. This, in addition to my other two points, leads me to my suggestion for hanging the dynamic.You have stopped having any needs from this person and are now in orbit around their need to be angry, rageful, and blaming. It is time to start making your needs known and be highly proactive, direct and confronting.When you need time to work and need quiet, I’d let her know straight away before you begin that you need her to be quiet, not other you, or leave the house, while you are working. I’d encourage you to make this a clear need.Secondly, I’ll also encourage you to respond directly when she is mouthing off, blaming, or being out of control with her rage. Your job is to assert your own needs in the relationship. Tell her every time she is out of mine, belittles you, blames you, or disrespect your needs. She has no boundaries with you except the ones set when you stood up. Stand up for yourself regularly. Become highly assertive with her. It has worked because people like this family member only get their power through intimidation. Once you are no longer intimidated, they fold.All this having been said there are three typical causes for someone with the kind of profile this family member has. Often there is alcoholism or abuse in their history and programs like AA might be helpful if they would attend. There is also the possibility of certain types of personality disorders that can cause this. Typically, a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist can help with this diagnosis. Finally, there are medical conditions that can be underneath all this and a neurologist may be the best professional to help.If my suggestion about your speaking up doesn’t work after a month or so I’d suspect it may be one of the other three causes and follow up with those professionals would be in order.Wishing you patience and peace, "

Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nA common belief in this situation might be, \"If I don't react, she'll continue to control my life,\" or \"I must endure this to avoid conflict.\" These thoughts can create a sense of powerlessness and perpetuate the cycle of anger. Challenge these thoughts by considering, \"Is there a way to set boundaries without escalating the conflict?\"\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\n Reflect on past times when you stood up to her without violence. What worked? What didn't? How could you communicate your boundaries in a calm, assertive manner without provoking further aggression? Are there other family members who manage this situation without resorting to verbal abuse?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nInstead of reacting to her yelling, try practicing empathy and understanding. When she raises her voice, remind yourself that she might be under stress or facing her own issues. Set clear boundaries, like not engaging in conversations when she's in that state or seeking help from other family members or a professional mediator to mediate conflicts.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember that standing up to her is a positive step, but change may take time. Be patient with yourself and your family member. If her behavior persists, consider seeking professional help, such as therapy, to address the root causes of her anger and learn healthier coping mechanisms. It's okay to ask for support from friends, family, or a therapist to help you cope and maintain your own well-being.\n\nRemember, your own emotional well-being should always come first. Keep working on strategies that help you maintain a sense of calm and control in your interactions with her.",

        "question": "From a teen in the U.S.: For as long as I could remember I liked being alone. I think it’s starting to really effect me though as I start to get older and enter the adult world. Every time I’m out with friends I feel uncomfortable and awkward. I always feel like I’m putting a front or an act in front of everyone I speak to and I could only feel at ease when I’m at home by myself. When I’m alone I feel as though I don’t think. Like I’m just alone in my room for hours imagining a better life and different scenarios of my pretend life when really I’m just laying in bed doing nothing. Is that normal?",

            "No, you are not alone in this. At 17, you are aware of the increasing expectations (by yourself and others) for you to enter the adult world as a fully functioning adult person. Those expectations can be daunting. Since you find them overwhelming, it make sense that you retreat to daydreaming as an alternative to dealing with the difficult reality.However, this is a problem that only spirals downward. The more you retreat, the less comfortable you will be in the company of others. Instead of getting practice in communicating well and developing confidence in yourself, you are becoming convinced you can’t do either.It may be that you are developing the symptoms of social anxiety. Everyone has some degree of worry about how they will be received by others and whether they can manage the multiple demands of a social situation. But symptoms of social anxiety are not just a momentary case of “stage fright”. When social anxiety reaches a clinical level, the person becomes so fearful of the judgment of others and so convinced that she can’t fit into the social world that the stress is just too much to handle. People with social anxiety dread being in a variety of social situations. This can severely limit a person’s life.People tend to see those with social anxiety as shy or aloof or even snobbish. But the truth is that the client really does want to have positive relationships and to be included. The social anxiety has become a huge barrier.The physical symptoms of social anxiety are individual. Some people feel dizzy or lightheaded. Or they might feel tension in the body. Some people develop stomach pain and diarrhea or a racing heart, blushing or sweating. Meanwhile, the person perseverates about their fear that they will do or say something that will offend someone else or humiliate herself. Basic social skills dessert her.Such clients develop a variety of strategies for managing life. Some will only go anywhere if they are accompanied by someone they trust. Many significantly limit their contact with others. Others develop a full blown phobia and never leave their house.The good news is that social anxiety can be treated. The success rate is high. Research has shown that the treatment with the best results is active, structured, cognitive-behavioral therapy. This type of therapy has been shown to to change the neural pathways in the brain permanently.The earlier you get treatment, the less of your life will be wasted by holing up in your room. I urge you to make an appointment with a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders as soon as you can.While you wait for your appointment, you might find it helpful to read “Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy” by Dr. David Burns. In it, he explains social anxiety more fully than I can here. He also describes a number of techniques you can use to help yourself feel better and more self-confident.I wish you well."

        "cbt_answer": "I understand how you're feeling, and it's important to recognize that everyone has different comfort levels and preferences. What you're experiencing might be related to introversion, which is common and doesn't necessarily mean there's anything abnormal. However, it's also possible that these feelings are starting to impact your social interactions and daily life.\n\nFirst, let's validate your feelings: It's okay to feel more at ease in a familiar environment, like your home. Being alone can be a time for self-reflection and relaxation, but it's also important to maintain connections with others for emotional support and personal growth.\n\nKey Thought or Belief: You might be perceiving social situations as a performance or an obligation, believing that you need to put on a front to be accepted or liked by others. This belief might be causing anxiety and making you feel out of place.\n\nChallenge or Reflection: Is it possible that you're attributing too much pressure to social situations? Are there specific situations or events that make you feel this way? Are there any past experiences that might be contributing to this feeling?\n\nStrategy or Insight: One approach could be to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's normal to have preferences. Try to set realistic expectations for yourself, and don't compare yourself to others' social lives. Gradually, you can work on building your confidence by starting with small social interactions and gradually increasing them. It might also be helpful to communicate your feelings to your close friends or family, so they can better understand and support you.\n\nEncouragement and Foresight: Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace. It's not about being perfect, but about making strides towards feeling more comfortable in social situations. If these feelings persist or become a significant obstacle, consider seeking professional help from a therapist who specializes in CBT, as they can guide you through techniques to manage your anxiety and improve your social skills.\n\nRemember, building relationships takes time, and it's a process. If you're open to it, these changes can lead to a more balanced life and deeper connections with others.",

            "You mentioned that you are seeing a therapist next week. I’m wondering if you had seen a therapist previously since you have identified yourself as having generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). I highlight this only because it’s ill-advised to self-diagnose. Your therapist would be in the best position to give a proper diagnosis.You described an experience where you had crippling anxiety coupled with “super bad tremors.” These “super bad tremors” were so bad that they kept you from returning to work. It’s possible that you are describing a panic attack, something that I will describe more in depth below. But it’s also possible that you are describing a medical condition. It would be prudent to consult your primary care physician. They will rule out any possible medical conditions.Regarding panic attacks, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM), the guidebook used by mental health professionals to diagnose disorders, provides this definition. They define a panic attack as an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes. Individuals who have recurrent panic attacks may be diagnosed with panic disorder.GAD, on the other hand, involves excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for at least six months about a number of different events and activities. Individuals with GAD find it difficult to control their worrisome thoughts. In addition, they experience a number of other symptoms including but not limited to sleep disturbances, irritability, restlessness, and so forth. The anxiety common among GAD sufferers interferes with daily life activities and causes a significant level of distress. Having a panic attack is not a symptom of GAD. GAD and panic disorder are two different disorders.It’s also not uncommon for people prone to anxiety to worry that they are developing schizophrenia. In fact, it is one of the most common concerns that I see here at Psych Central. It’s probably due to the fact that people with anxiety disorders tend to worry about developing all sorts of ailments. Schizophrenia, in the minds of some people, is considered a very frightening disorder. Thus, it makes sense individuals with anxiety would be drawn to what they consider to be the worst possible scenario. None of the symptoms you described in your letter would suggest schizophrenia.I provided the aforementioned information to provide some insight into what clinicians consider when diagnosing mental health disorders. Gaining the proper diagnosis is important however, what might be most important, is treatment. The fact that you will be seeing a therapist is great news. Anxiety disorders are highly treatable conditions. Many people find therapy, and, in some cases medication, to be quite effective in treating their anxiety symptoms.You are on the right track. You recognize the problem exists and you’re seeking treatment. You are doing what you should be doing. I wish you luck with your efforts. Please take care."

        "cbt_answer": "Lillyan, I can understand how overwhelming it must be to experience your GAD at such a young age. It's important to validate your feelings and know that your experiences are not uncommon in the context of anxiety. Your off-the-wall thoughts and the need to block out sounds are often a manifestation of your heightened anxiety, which can sometimes lead to these automatic associations.\n\nFirstly, I want to emphasize that your thoughts and sensations are a symptom of your anxiety disorder, and they do not necessarily mean you will develop schizophrenia. It's common for people with anxiety to have these kinds of racing thoughts or misinterpretations. The important thing is to challenge these thoughts with evidence from your reality. When you hear a sound, take a deep breath, and try to determine if there is an actual cause or if it's just your anxiety making you overreact.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in feeling like you're full of it, and it's understandable that family members might struggle to fully understand your experience. It's crucial to have a safe and non-judgmental space to discuss this with your therapist, who will help you work through these thoughts.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some strategies to manage your anxiety:\n\n1. Mindfulness practices: Try deep breathing exercises or meditation to help you stay present and reduce your anxiety when these thoughts arise.\n2. Cognitive restructuring: When you notice these thoughts, challenge them by asking if they are based on facts or just your anxiety. Practice replacing negative thoughts with more realistic ones.\n3. Gradual exposure: If you can, slowly expose yourself to situations that trigger your anxiety (like sounds or situations) in a controlled and supportive environment.\n4. Sleep and self-care: Make sure you're getting enough rest and engaging in activities that help you relax, like reading or gentle exercise.\n\nRemember, it's okay to seek professional help, and your therapist will provide tailored guidance and support. Keep in mind that recovery takes time and it's a process. With patience and consistency, you'll start to regain control over your anxiety.\n\nI look forward to seeing you in your therapy session and wish you all the best in your journey towards clarity and relief.",

            "Faith in God is good but it’s not a substitute for mental health treatment. Sometimes very religious people believe that prayer is the only thing that can help. If praying alone worked, then we would have no worldly problems. Praying is good, but perhaps God answers you by directing you to a therapist.You’ve been experiencing symptoms for seven years and they seem to have progressed. One should always be proactive with their mental health and with health in general. If you noticed a lump on your back, for instance, you’d be ill-advised to ignore it. If that lump turned out to be cancer you would have wasted value time. The importance of early diagnosis in cancer and mental illness cannot be overemphasized. I’m obviously not suggesting that you have cancer. I’m simply trying to make the point that early detection and appropriate care for a potential mental illness is immensely important for your overall psychological health and well-being. Put more simply, you should not ignore your symptoms.As you know, when you don’t feel well psychologically, it affects all aspects of your life including, work, school, relationships, and so forth. Most mental illnesses are highly treatable, especially in the early stages of development. The sooner one receives treatment, the easier it will be to restore one’s psychological health.I would suggest contacting a mental health professional to assist you in determining what might be wrong and most importantly, to begin treatment. Going to therapy doesn’t mean you are weak or that you would have to stop praying (if you pray). It’s nothing like that. Religion and therapy are not mutually exclusive. You can do both — pray and seek therapy. In fact, it’s not uncommon for churches to offer therapeutic services. Think of a therapist like you would a dentist or anyone who has spent many years in school learning highly specific skills. Your goals in therapy are ultimately yours to decide but generally they are to reduce one’s symptoms, restore one’s level of functioning and to live a happy, more satisfied life.You can start the process of seeking professional help by contacting your primary care physician and asking for a referral. They often are aware of mental health resources and providers in the community. Another option is to contact your insurance company and ask them for a referral. If you don’t have insurance, contact your local community mental health center and ask how they can help. Community mental health centers often offer free or very low-cost services to those in need. Do whatever is necessary in order to get the treatment you need. Treatment does work, but you have to be willing to try it. Good luck and please take care."

It sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of a condition like anxiety or a mental health disorder, and it's important to seek professional help.\n\nFirst, let's validate your feelings. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and scared given the intensity of the thoughts and sensations you're experiencing. You're not alone, and it's crucial to recognize that seeking help is a brave step towards healing.\n\nNow, let's identify the key thought or belief that might be contributing to these distressing beliefs. One such belief might be that your thoughts and behaviors are solely due to a lack of faith in God, rather than considering that they could be symptoms of an underlying mental health issue. It's common for people to have unhelpful thoughts like this, but they can be challenged through the lens of CBT.\n\nChallenging this belief: Can you think of times when these thoughts and feelings have persisted even when you felt strong in your faith? Have there been moments when you sought guidance or support from your faith community without these experiences occurring?\n\nNext, let's discuss practical strategies. Consider seeking a mental health professional, such as a therapist who specializes in anxiety or paranoid disorders. They can provide a structured approach to understanding and managing these thoughts and behaviors. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be particularly helpful in teaching you coping techniques to manage your symptoms.\n\nAdditionally, learning relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, mindfulness, or progressive muscle relaxation, can help reduce anxiety and improve your ability to regulate your emotions. It's also important to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that your worth isn't tied to your ability to form relationships or maintain a job.\n\nRemember, recovery is a process, and progress may not always be linear. Be patient with yourself and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. It's crucial to know that there are resources available to help you navigate these challenges.\n\nIn the future, if you struggle with maintaining a job or leaving the house, consider discussing these challenges with your therapist and exploring options for workplace accommodations or support systems in your community. Your faith community can also play a supportive role, but it's important to understand that seeking professional help is not a replacement for evidence-based treatment.\n\nI encourage you to take that first step and reach out to a mental health professional.

            "Insomnia is no joke. Not getting sufficient sleep at any age, but especially as a teen, is serious business. Sleep disorders can cause depression, anxiety, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. According to a poll done in 2005 by Sleep in America, people who were diagnosed with depression or anxiety were more likely to sleep less than six hours at night. A study done in 2007 showed that people with insomnia are 5 times as likely to be depressed as those who got sufficient sleep. At your age “sufficient” means 8 – 9 hours a night.I urge you to go back to your medical doctor for more tests. I’m alarmed that you were drinking enough but not staying hydrated. There’s more to that than sleep deprivation. I’m also alarmed that apparently you were given a “diagnosis” but not then given a treatment plan to regulate your sleep.If your primary care physician isn’t able to help you, get a referral to a sleep medicine clinic for a sleep study. Such clinics do a thorough evaluation of how much sleep a person gets and how often and for how long the person is awake. You may be sent home with a monitor to wear. More likely, you will be asked to spend the night at the clinic where they will monitor you throughout the night. You will sleep in a comfortable room in a comfortable bed. You can usually even bring your own pajamas.Don’t be scared. A sleep study isn’t painful. Doctors or technicians will monitor you while you sleep. Little disks called electrodes will be temporarily glued to your head and attached to an EEG (electroencephalogram) machine. This will monitor the electrical impulses in your brain while you sleep and will show the technician how you are moving through the stages of sleep. It will measure possible interruptions in the pattern of your sleep. The technicians will also measure things such as eye movements, oxygen levels in your blood, heart and breathing rates, who much you snore, and how your body moves as you sleep.The data from your sleep study will be evaluated by your doctor. You will then have a follow up appointment with your doctor to discuss the results and what may need to be done to help you have more regular and restorative sleep.Please share this response with your parents. I don’t think you are lying or faking. I think you have an untreated medical condition that left untreated will only make things worse.I wish you well."

            "It’s impossible to give a diagnosis over the Internet. Any time you are experiencing concerning symptoms, it is wise to consult a professional, in-person. You would consult a professional if you needed a lawyer, help with your taxes, or you had a dental problem. It’s the same thing when it comes to mental health — you consult a professional. Mental health professionals have specialized knowledge in an area they have rigorously studied for years. One should always consult professionals when possible. To answer your direct question, yes you should “see someone” and that person is a mental health professional.One way to find a good mental health professional is to ask your primary care physician for a referral. Sometimes they know people in the community who can help. You can also do a Google search for mental health professionals in your community. There are reviews of mental health professionals available via the internet. You want to choose at least three or four, call them and speak to them on the phone. Tell them about the issues you would like help with and ask how they would help you. Choose the one you feel you connect with the best and meet with them in person. That will likely be your best choice.Suicidal thoughts are always concerning. Their presence suggests that you are experiencing an abnormal level of distress. You also mentioned that you do things slowly but I’m not certain what you mean by that. Sometimes doing things slowly is what is necessary.Having difficulty sleeping is sometimes indicative of depression. Some people with depression sleep a lot and some people with depression don’t sleep much at all.If I were able to interview you in person, I would have many questions. What, if anything, has changed lately? When did this begin? Did something happen in your life that has caused your depression? What could explain the changes you have described in this letter? If depression is present, it doesn’t come out of nowhere. Something had to have caused you to feel this way. It would obviously be tremendously helpful if you could identify the potential underlying cause of these feelings.Try to think about what may be wrong or what may have started this. You might try keeping a diary or journal in which you track your thoughts and feelings. It can be quite therapeutic. It could also assist you in understanding the origins of this issue and in potentially uncovering patterns that you may have overlooked. Writing can also help to clarify your thinking. Studies have indicated that there are many psychological health benefits to writing.It’s good that you are aware of these potential problems and that you are open to seeking help.

Validation and Empathy: It's okay to have worries and it's common to feel a mix of emotions, including self-doubt and impulsiveness. It's important to remember that experiencing suicidal thoughts doesn't necessarily mean you have depression, but it's crucial to address them. It's also important to recognize that seeking help is a sign of strength, not a sign of fakery.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief: One key thought is the belief that depression is only \"bad\" in a severe sense, but your description of feeling slowed down and reduced joy suggests a milder form. The idea that others might fake depression and the belief in self-doubt (\"I am a failure\") are also contributing to your uncertainty. These thoughts might be distorted, as they often don't accurately represent reality.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection: Consider that while some people may fake depression for attention or sympathy, your experience and the presence of suicidal thoughts suggest a more personal issue. Your feelings, even if they change, are valid and should be taken seriously. It's important to reevaluate if your current situation is affecting your daily functioning and enjoyment.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: It might be helpful to start by talking to a mental health professional who can help assess your symptoms and provide an accurate diagnosis.

            "I think you have some decisions to make about how you want to be in the world. You describe yourself as “extremely intellectual” yet feel contempt for others who may not be so endowed. You describe yourself as observant, and yet only seem to be observing ignorance and ineptitude. You see where others are stuck, and yet cannot find a way to help. Instead your sense of preeminence has you as a witness to other’s despair, but only seem able to manipulate others and identify them as “machines devoid of sense and independent thought.”If you do have this high degree of perception it is curious that it isn’t balanced. It is colored by a sense of superiority that diminishes rather than attempts to help others. Perhaps the work for you isn’t to notice how others won’t be able to understand you, but what you might need to do to learn how to help alleviate other’s suffering. What seems lacking is a sense of empathy, compassion, and kindness. Your high degree of perception has a blind spot.To counteract this (if you care to) I recommend learning more about who you are, your potential, and what character strengths you possess. Character strengths are those abilities that, when used in the right way, improve our well-being and help others.There are a total of 24 character strengths based on six virtues with over 8 million people having taken it. Look at this list of character strengths and virtues. You will see the six virtues followed by the character strengths associated with them.I’d begin by taking the viacharacter.org strength survey to learn more specifically about what you are good at—and then learn how to use and improve these strengths. This will allow you to use your keep perception of other’s needs and find ways to support rather than distance yourself from them. This will give you the “human contact” you are looking for.Wishing you patience and peace, "

        "cbt_answer": "I can understand how you might feel overwhelmed by your sensitivity to people and the challenges it brings, both in terms of charm and the weight of knowing others' motivations. It sounds like you might be struggling with a belief that people are insensitive or lacking in independent thought, and that your intellect makes you feel like an outsider in human interactions.\n\nFirst, let's validate your feelings. It's natural to feel disillusioned and frustrated when you perceive others as not recognizing the depth of their own choices. It's important to remember that our perception of others' motivations is often filtered through our own experiences and biases.\n\nKey Thought or Belief: \"People are slow and unwise, and my intellect makes me feel like an alien in human interactions.\"\n\nChallenge or Reflection: Have you considered that perhaps people's actions and reactions are complex, influenced by many factors, including their own unique backgrounds and perspectives? Also, has it ever occurred to you that your charm might be a result of your genuine interest and empathy, rather than just manipulation?\n\nStrategy or Insight: Instead of seeing their perceived lack of insight as a personal failure, try actively listening to their experiences and perspectives. Remember, empathy is about understanding, not always having all the answers. You could also practice withholding judgment and acknowledging that everyone's journey is different.\n\nEncouragement and Foresight: It's okay to seek connection and try new ways to engage with others. You may find that open and honest communication, rather than playing tricks, can foster deeper understanding. Remember, being right isn't the only goal – sometimes it's about human connection and growth.\n\nRemember, whether you see yourself as an alien or not, you're a valuable individual with unique insights to offer. Embrace this aspect of your intelligence and work on finding ways to connect with others while respecting their autonomy. If you continue to struggle, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can help you navigate these thoughts and emotions within a CBT framework.",

No matter what C did to S, S always forgave C instantly, but never me if I did anything similar.",

            "I’m so very sorry that you are hurting. Breaking up with someone we love is one of the hardest things to do. But please take this man at his word. He is doing his best to let you down without devastating you. He is clearly not willing or able to pursue the kind of relationship you want. Ironically, it would be easier on you if he wasn’t so supportive of you. His kind words give you hope.I wonder if you are holding on because you are still dealing with anxiety about where you are living and the things you said were happening. The relationship probably helped you cope. Now you are called upon to not lean on him but to figure out how to manage on your own.You are not at all alone in your anxiety. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting about 40 million adults. The good news is that it is treatable.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been found to be a very effective form of talk therapy. Often this is supplemented by some medication and coaching in some kind of mindfulness technique.At this point, it’s a mistake to try to get the guy to change his mind. You need to focus on changing your response to difficulty. If you could do that on your own, I think you would have done so already. For that reason, I encourage you to find a therapist who can provide you with the support and unconditional acceptance that your former boyfriend can’t.I wish you well,"

It's common to question why someone would choose to stay with someone who treats them poorly.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief: It seems that you might be believing a core belief that your loyalty and efforts are not valued as much as C's actions, despite your better intentions. You might be thinking, \"If S forgives C easily, it means I'm not good enough or that my efforts don't matter.\"\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection: It's important to consider if your friend's behavior is truly based on your actions, or if there's a deeper issue in their relationship or your role. Have you had open discussions about your concerns, or are you assuming the worst because of their pattern of forgiveness?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: It's crucial to set boundaries and communicate your feelings clearly. Let S know how their choices affect you, and consider seeking a neutral third party, like a counselor or therapist, to help facilitate a conversation. Remember, it's not your responsibility to fix their relationship, and it's okay to prioritize your own well-being.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight: Use this experience as an opportunity to reflect on your own self-worth and assertiveness. Don't let it consume your self-esteem. Keep your close friendships, but also recognize that it's healthy to surround yourself with people who value and appreciate you.

            "I admire the bravery you are displaying in talking about these fantasies, urges, and preferences. What is most important about your thinking is that you are questioning yourself. I think you are asking a good question by reflecting on your preferences.You are right in noting that ephebophilia defines the primary sexual interest of mid to late adolescents—roughly 15 to 19, but from your description, this may not be your primary age-range preference. The presence of some level of sexual attraction doesn’t qualify as ephebophilia.Sexologists will often use specific terms for age group preference. Since you’ve identified yourself in your profile as a 20-year-old and you are primarily attracted to people your age this would technically qualify you as someone primarily attracted to adults, or what sexologist would call teleiophilia. If the attraction were to a younger, prepubescent children younger the term hebephilia would be used.Although these types of urges and fantasies are often referred to as paraphilia, or a sexual fetish, sexologists do not agree on the nature, range, or diversity of unusual sexual interests and paraphilias. But there are two things that most would agree on.The first has to do with the age of consent, which differs in different localities, as being a clear dividing line between urges and action. Your sensitivity to the idea that acting on some of these urges would be wrong is important to maintain. Consent given by someone not of age would not be valid.Secondly, it would be the distress or interpersonal difficulties caused by having these thoughts that would be important for you to seek counseling. If they interfered with your relationships with others, or caused undo distress you may want to talk with a professional about it. If this is the case the find help tab at the top of the page can help you find someone in your area.Wishing you patience and peace, "

        "cbt_answer": "Thank you for sharing your experience with me. It sounds like a difficult time for both you and your partner. I can understand how the uncertainty and anxiety you felt during your breakup and the inconsistent behavior might have added to your distress. Let's explore these aspects through the lens of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n\n1. Validation and Empathy: It's normal to feel hurt and confused after a breakup, especially when love and commitment were involved. I acknowledge that it must have been challenging for you to navigate the situation while dealing with your own anxiety.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief: A potential core belief here might be: \"If we were truly meant to be together, he would be more consistent and he wouldn't say such hurtful things.\" This belief might be causing you to doubt your own worth and his feelings.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection: It's essential to consider whether this belief is rational or if it's based on a few isolated incidents. Have you had open, honest conversations about his feelings? Have you tried to understand his perspective on his \"hot and cold\" behavior?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: Instead of focusing on the lack of consistency, try to approach your relationship with clear boundaries and communication. Set expectations for both of you on what \"consistent\" means to you. It might also be helpful to seek therapy for yourselves to work through your individual issues and improve your coping skills with anxiety.\n\n5.

If you decide to reevaluate the relationship, make sure you're doing so from a place of self-care and understanding. If needed, consider seeking professional support to navigate these emotions.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own well-being and make a decision that feels best for you.

The first is that there is a very healthy part of you that knows these concerns aren’t how you’d like to feel.

It's common for people to have sexual fantasies, and they can vary in content. The key here is to recognize that these fantasies are separate from reality and not necessarily a reflection of your actual behaviors or choices.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nI can see how these fantasies might be a normal part of your sexual exploration, and it's essential to acknowledge that they don't define who you are as a person. It's crucial to ensure that you maintain healthy boundaries and treat others with respect, especially in real-life situations.\n\n2.

You might also hold the belief that these fantasies are a justification for engaging in any real-life sexual activities with minors, which is absolutely not the case.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you reflect on why these fantasies are restricted to a specific age range? Are there any concerns or guilt related to engaging with someone younger? How would you feel if you acted on these fantasies, knowing the legal and ethical consequences?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nTo cope with these thoughts, it's essential to practice healthy communication and self-reflection. If you find these fantasies distressing, consider keeping them private and not acting on them. If you struggle with guilt or external pressures, consider discussing your concerns with a therapist or a trusted friend to gain different perspectives.\n\n5.

            "Even though you said a lot in your letter, you didn’t get to what I think are the most important things. You are lonely in your own house, living in a family where people don’t talk to each other. Your boyfriend’s brother is 11 and lonesome too. He only sees his father every other week so your boyfriend is important to him as a kind of father figure. From the brother’s point of view, you are competition for your boyfriend’s love and attention. He can’t stand it so makes a pest of himself, hoping you’ll go away. His mother may not know how to respond to his loneliness so counts on her older son to do what she thinks she can’t.I think both sets of parents think that what you mean by wanting privacy is that you want to have sex. They aren’t comfortable with that, so they put up obstacles to you and your boyfriend being together. He isn’t allowed at your house. His mother makes having private time in his house impossible. You are experiencing what many young people go through as they explore a serious relationship but with no place of their own.The antidote is more clear communication. Your boyfriend could talk to his mom about how he can’t be a substitute dad for his brother. She needs to give him more of her time, instead of asking your boyfriend to give all of his free time to brotherly love.You could talk to your parents about how to loosen up the rules so that your boyfriend can be there. That probably means talking about boundaries around privacy and sex. And your boyfriend needs to have the same conversation with his mother. If the two of you are mature enough and sure enough of your relationship to want to be sexually active, you are mature enough to have difficult conversations.I have a guess that both sets of parents are concerned that you two are too exclusive. If you don’t have other friends as well, they are right to be concerned. Instead of limiting the relationship you do have, it would be more helpful if they would encourage you to enrich your friendships and to bring other people home to meet them and enjoy their company.At 18, you are both close to a time when you will be able to get out on your own. Being clear now with each other about your expectations and limitations regarding closeness and sex will help you manage your situation for the next year. I hope you are both doing well in school and making plans for the future — be it more schooling, training in a tech job, or full time work. Supporting each other in future planning will also help strengthen your relationship in the present.I wish you well. "

It's possible your social anxiety is causing these changes. You might benefit from speaking to a mental health professional, such as a psychologist, to get a proper assessment and determine the cause. CBT can help you learn coping mechanisms for social anxiety and help you understand when your thoughts are distorted.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few strategies to consider:\n1. Gradual exposure: If social anxiety is the issue, try gradually exposing yourself to social situations, starting with smaller ones and building up.\n2. Mindfulness: Practice mindfulness techniques to stay present and manage anxiety as it arises.\n3. Cognitive restructuring: Challenge negative thoughts and replace them with more realistic and positive ones.\n4. Self-care: Make sure to prioritize your physical and emotional well-being, including getting enough sleep, exercise, and healthy eating.\n\nEncouragement and Foresight:\nRemember that seeking help is a sign of strength, and it's okay to take your time to understand what's happening.

It could be that there is more to his relationship with “C” than you know. Whatever it is, “S” isn’t giving you enough information to understand it and hasn’t asked for your help in dealing with it.From my point of view, you are asking the wrong question: Your energy would be much better spent investigation why you stick with this friend who isn’t a friend to you and who, in fact, emotionally abuses you. Your relationship seems very one sided, with you always “being there” but “S” putting his attention on “C”. Why are you interested in salvaging a relationship where your love and care isn’t returned?

There is no bullshit POSITIVE thinking that”s going to not make me hate everything about myself or being gay. When you have spent almost the entire time you”ve been out (since 2007) being told that your life is worthless because of how you look means that PEOPLE will not get any better either.

So why write to a blog called “Ask The Therapist,” when you have nothing to ask?Maybe you just want to “Tell The Therapist” something. Maybe you want to tell a therapist that who we are and what we do are not valuable. That no matter what we do to be effective it wont work. That we are unable to change what is and thinking otherwise makes us foolish. In fact, it seems as if you’d like us to feel bad about who we are and what we do. That positive thinking is bullshit and that we should just give up. That we will never be effective because people don’t change.It sounds like you want us to feel like you do. That is how it works, I suppose. When people are feeling bad they very often want to have others understand their pain by saying and doing things to create that feeling in others. There is a saying: “Hurt people hurt people.” The human tendency is to make others try to feel the pain we are feeling so that our situation, our life can be understood. I could be wrong about that in your instance, but without a question and with such clarity about how you feel it is one way to explain the contradiction of why you’d be telling instead of asking.In my opinion one non-bullshit thing psychology has found is that if you don’t believe you can change you probably won’t.Wishing you patience and peace, "

Pose Challenge or Reflection: It's understandable to feel skeptical about the effectiveness of therapy, given past unsuccessful experiences. However, it's crucial to remember that therapy is not a cure-all and that everyone's journey is unique. It's not about overselling the effectiveness; rather, it's about finding the right approach and therapist who can understand and accommodate your needs.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: While CBT may not immediately change your feelings about yourself, it can help you develop coping strategies to deal with the distressing thoughts and emotions. It can also teach you how to identify and challenge distorted thoughts, which could lead to a more balanced perspective. If money is an issue, consider looking for sliding scale options, community mental health services, or online therapy platforms that might be more accessible.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight: It's understandable that you feel skeptical, but it's important to remember that progress may not be linear. If you're struggling with despair, please consider reaching out to support groups or trusted friends who can provide emotional support. Over time, with consistent effort, therapy can improve, even if it doesn't change everything overnight. It's okay to take things at your own pace.\n\nIn your situation, therapists might focus on validating your experiences and working with you to develop coping mechanisms to manage the distress caused by your conditions and online harassment. It's crucial to find a therapist who listens to your concerns and adapts their approach to fit your needs.\n\nRemember, therapy is not a competition for money or a quick fix; it's a process of learning, growth, and healing. It's possible that you might need to explore different types of therapy or work with a therapist who specializes in managing complex issues. It's never too late to seek help, and your well-being should always be a top priority.",

            "I’m very glad you wrote. It must feel terrible to be so confused and depressed. I’m going to tell you what I’m sure you already know. You cannot sort out your identity or deal with your anxiety and depression without also addressing your substance abuse. Both issues have to be dealt with at the same time. One of my guesses is that you abuse drugs or alcohol to deaden your pain. But when you get even a bit sober, your problems are still there.People with both substance abuse and mental health issues often have family problems. I suspect that your difficulty with relatives is born of shame about your substance abuse (and maybe other things as well). Maybe you protect yourself from judgment by avoiding them and being angry. Strangers (by definition, people who don’t know you) may seem safer company. You can present yourself in any way you want with a stranger, but you can’t fool a relative for long.I don’t have enough information to comment much on your feelings that you might prefer to be a woman, especially since you stated that you were sexually abused as a young teen. It’s possible that your concerns about your sexual identity are a reaction to the abuse. It’s also possible that you are coming to terms with the feeling that your gender assignment at birth wasn’t accurate. You would find it helpful to confer with an expert on sexual identity to help you sort this out.A dual diagnosis (substance abuse and mental health issues) tends to be difficult to manage and to have a great potential for relapse. That’s why you need to deal with both at once. Such an integrated treatment usually includes some behavioral therapy (like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Dialectical Behavior Therapy) to help you learn new ways to cope with distress, medication if needed for your anxiety and depression, psycho-education to give you new understanding of your problems, as well as relapse prevention strategies. Some programs also include classes in mindfulness meditation as a tool for calming yourself. Close collaboration of your helpers makes success more likely.I hope you can find a program in your country that can provide you with the guidance and support you need. If not, consider exploring some of the online support and recovery programs for dual diagnosis.I wish you well."

            "Thank you for writing. Being 14 is really hard these days; I think even harder than it was in my generation. There is so much pressure to be in a relationship, even if you’re not really ready. To escape the pressure, some kids find a “safe” relationship. This might be with a good friend of the other sex who also wants to have fun but stay platonic. Other straight kids sometimes find gay friends to take the issue of sex out of the relationship. It’s another way to be social and have fun without the pressure.On the other hand, you are at an age when your body is changing and you may find you are more emotional than you used to be. It is normal to be exploring your own emerging sexuality. It often takes years to settle into yourself. In time, you may find you are straight, bi, nonbinary, trans, or sexually fluid. Maybe you are now exploring other possibilities besides being straight to try to understand who you are.We live in a time where there is more visibility and more conversation about other ways of being besides just straight or just gay. In addition, rigid stereotypes about how to be a man or woman are being challenged. Kids have a wider range to explore about how to be and be accepted by their peers and the adults who love them. It can be felt as a relief or as more pressure.If there are adults in your life that you trust who have had different life experiences, you might seek them out to talk about their perspectives about what it was like to be a teen struggling with definition of self.There’s no right time or right way to figure it out. Stay open and curious and accepting of yourself. You will know when you are ready.Avoid making an announcement of your identity until you are pretty sure. No matter what your identity, there will be new pressures from both people who support you and people who don’t. Take your time until you can be as clear and strong about your discoveries as you know how to be. There’s no hurry.At 14, every year seems like it takes forever. That’s because it’s only a fourteenth of your life. As you get older each year will seem longer because it is a smaller and smaller percentage of your life. My point is that you have decades to figure this out and celebrate who you truly are with the people who will love and respect you for you.I wish you well. "

            "It must have been very difficult for you to manage not having your daughter with you. Since you’ve used many abbreviations readers may not know I want to begin with some definitions. You said your mother has NPD, BPD, Dissociative Disorder. Lets review each of these in turn:Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), (popularly referred to as narcissism) is different than someone having narcissistic traits because of its severity. A personality disorder is defined as a consistent pattern of internal experience and behavior that deviates differs from the norm of the individual’s culture. According to Steve Bressert, Ph.D.,  an individual with NPD:Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a mental illness that manifests with impulsive behaviors and typically varying mood swings and erratic and often volatile and self-injurious behaviors, including risky sexual behaviors, cutting, or suicide attempts. The main features are instability in relationships fueled by a fear of abandonment. People with BPD often feel “empty” and struggle with their identity. To learn more about BPD check here.Dissociative Disorder (often known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) has several symptoms, but the primary one is that it disrupts the person’s sense of continuous identity.There is a gap between one’s sense of self and motivation toward one’s goals with changes in emotional expression, behaviors, memories, feelings, and perceptions. Often these gaps result in memory loss of everyday events, including the specific features of one’s own personality and identity. These disruptions cause gaps in memory that are beyond what would be considered normal forgetting causing significant stress in the person’s life as it directly impacts the quality of relationships.In the past DID was known as (and is still sometimes referred to as) Multiple Personality Disorder where other “personalities” or personality states manifest. These often include different voices and is a way the psyche tries to deal with trauma or abuse. A common symptom is for an individual with DID to lose track of time and there may be significant intervals that are lost due to one of the entities takes control. To learn more about it check here.If your mother was diagnosed with all three of these illnesses I can only imagine how difficult it is to get along with her.Child Protective Services (CPS) apparently awarded your child to her and you believe your mom has brainwashed her to alienate from you, creating Parental Alienation Syndrome PAS. PAS was identified by psychiatrist Richard Gardner as a: “disorder that arises primarily in the context of child custody disputes. Its primary manifestation is the child’s campaign of denigration against a parent, a campaign that has no justification. It is caused by a combination of a programming (brainwashing) parent’s indoctrinations and the child’s own contributions to the vilification of the targeted parent.”While it is most often found between divorced parents it can also be found in other familial situations like yours.You wanting your daughter to know who her grandmother really is will simply be using the same tactic you are accusing your mother of using with her—trying to convince your daughter that she (not you) is the bad one. You’d be using the same method to achieve the same goal—of alienating your daughter from your mother.I’d recommend that you and your daughter go to family therapy together with a qualified marriage and family therapist. You can find on at the top of the page on the “find help” tab, or you can check out this organization to find a family therapist near you. Be sure the person you get is familiar with Parental Alienation as this is not a topic every therapist will be familiar with dealing with, but that most family therapists will understand.Trying to convince your daughter on your own without professional guidance is not likely to help as much as you would want because of the above reason. Having a professional present who has worked with these issues before will be safer, and likely a better way to develop a relationship with your daughter.Wishing you patience and peace, "

Validation and Empathy:\nFirst, let's acknowledge your feelings and the complexity of the situation.

The belief you're trying to challenge might be that her behavior is a reflection of you or that you're not a good enough parent.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nInstead of directly telling her everything, consider starting a conversation about how you've been feeling since the separation and the importance of setting healthy boundaries.

            "It is time to move out. At 25 you need to be having your own life, your own space, and to detach from your parent’s influence. It is overdue. If you were 14 this would be a very different situation — and your parents would have a lot more need to influence and guide your life. But you are a fully-grown woman and you can’t afford (for you emotional well-being) to stay at home. You need a plan to leave. I’m suggesting three stages:The first is to foster the cat so you are free to make the move when you are ready. I think you’ve hit on a very good idea in putting her into the care of someone else while you get your own life squared away.Moving in with your boyfriend temporarily is a good second step to consider. Stop paying to live at home when there is nothing but aggravation and a lack of gratitude. Testing out how to live together is a good experiment for your independence from your mother and stepfather, and sampling how it will be with your boyfriend.Finally, if your boyfriend doesn’t want to live together until after he is out of the Air Force, your plan of getting out doesn’t change. Now you find the coworker and ignore you mother and stepfather if they “flip out.” Stop putting your life on hold to try and please them, make them happy, or keep them from getting upset. This is your life and the struggle to find your own way is important.This third step is necessary not only if your boyfriend doesn’t want to live together now, but also because he’ll be in the Air Force for a while and you’ll want to be independent from your parents. You may need to find a roommate and work extra time to afford to be independent, but it is worth the effort. Living with parents who do not let you become the adult you need to be isn’t healthy. As much as your boyfriend is a catalyst for you getting out of the house the goal is for you to get out not necessarily only to live with him.In psychology the process you are going through is known as individuation. It means that you are beginning to recognize and differentiate who you are by making efforts to get your own needs met.Wishing you patience and peace, "

            "Thanks for taking the time to write to us about your concerns. I think it is important to begin with an understanding of what the difference is between psychopath and sociopath, and then move on to understanding normal teenage thinking. I have written about this in the past, but want to include it here as I believe it is very important in answering your question.To begin with, there is no actual diagnosis in the official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM V) that offers a classification for either “psychopath” or “sociopath.” There are many terms like this that are used in the popular press but do not have an official diagnostic category. Terms like “codependency” are like this as well. They may have common usage, but not used for diagnostic purposes. So understanding the difference between the two terms will involve the official labels and the expert’s opinion.The official diagnostic term for psychopath and sociopath is Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) that includes a pattern of symptoms often beginning around age 15 or older that include many of these symptoms:Most clinical experts on the subject believe those identified as a psychopath or sociopath share some of the above characteristics. The most profound characteristic is that of a profoundly poor sense of right and wrong with little empathy or remorse for other people’s feelings. In other words, one major difference is the degree to which they have a conscience. A psychopath doesn’t, although there is a good chance he will pretend to. A sociopath has a conscience, but this conscience is not strong enough to stop the behavior. They may know that something is wrong but not be able to hold back from doing the behavior. What’s important here is that the behavior may look identical, but the degree to which they might feel bad about it would differ.Both will steal your money: the sociopath would know that that was the wrong thing to do. The psychopath wouldn’t know and if they did they wouldn’t care. They are also more likely to be charming, intelligent and able to mimic emotions to get over on people. Sociopaths don’t typically have this finesse. They are blunt about being self-serving and are quick to blame others for their behavior. Psychopaths get calm under stress which helps them not fear the consequences of their actions: sociopaths less so.The balance and tipping point is the degree to which someone with an antisocial personality disorder has empathy. While both lake the usual doses of empathic awareness for others, the psychopath doesn’t have the ability to understand how someone else feels. Other are simply pawns used for personal gains—not individuals with feelings that can be hurt.About two-thirds of individuals with ASPD are men, and while Hollywood loves to portray them as vicious and violent, the vast majority are not. Manipulative, reckless, and uncaring, but not necessarily violent. Mean, selfish, narcissistic people may be tempting to be labeled as ASPD, yet these inconsiderate traits are not enough to get the diagnosis.All this having been said the more likely thing is that you are having very normal, very common adolescent thoughts. You list your age as 14 and during this time there is a high degree of self-concerns, meaning it is very typical for the focus to be on one’s self and uniqueness. Classically, seeing one’s self as different from everyone else comes with this phase of development. This is the time teenagers break away from parents and convention and try to figure out their identity and are more concerned about understanding their special gifts and talents than the concerns of others.What you’ve identified in your email sounds like the normal process of maturing rather than pathology. My encouragement is for you to figure out what your strengths are and learn more about using them to develop those skill that will be important in your life for success.Wishing you patience and peace, "

Challenge or Reflection: Can you see how this belief might lead to difficulties in empathizing with others and their struggles? Also, do you think your focus on being \"rich and famous\" could be an extension of wanting to be in control and not getting easily bored by others' problems?\n3. Strategy or Insight: To improve empathy, try acknowledging and accepting that everyone has their own unique challenges and feelings.

(To learn more about PTSD, please read here.) But there are many variations of what causes a posttraumatic stress disorder, one of which is known as Complex PTSD (C-PTSD.)You will learn in this link that C-PTSD has different criteria than the diagnosis for PTSD, but this differential is subtle and not often fully recognized, even by therapists. Also, C-PTSD is not a formal diagnosis that appears in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) which is used by clinicians for identifying a collection of symptoms. It is classically seen as something that has emerged from an assortment of different sources:I am not suggesting that you have this, but I am suggesting it may be worth talking to the original therapist who diagnosed you and ask them to share their thoughts about their diagnosis or to make an appointment with a clinical psychologist who is licensed to be able to perform testing that could help you identify your diagnosis more readily. Because C-PTSD isn’t an official category in the DSM individuals who may meet its criteria may have been given the label PTSD because it is the only one officially recognized.Also, as a side note, if you haven’t read the extraordinary memoir Autobiography of A Face  by Lucy Greay, I’d encourage you to put it on your list.Wishing you patience and peace, "

        "cbt_answer": "I understand that being diagnosed with PTSD at such a young age must have been quite challenging for you, given all the physical and emotional upheavals you've experienced. Here's my response from a CBT perspective:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and possibly confused by the diagnosis given your complex background. Facing so many surgeries and the physical aspect can be quite traumatic. I can imagine that the emotional impact might have been hard to cope with.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief: A possible key thought or belief might be, \"My PTSD is a result of everything that's happened to me, and it will always be with me.\" This belief might lead to feelings of helplessness and vulnerability.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection: How about considering this thought: \"While my past experiences have shaped my PTSD, it doesn't define me entirely. It's possible to learn coping mechanisms and work through these feelings.\"\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: You might find it helpful to learn relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, mindfulness, or progressive muscle relaxation, to manage your stress and anxiety. Journaling or talking to a trusted friend or support group can also aid in processing your emotions. Additionally, seeking professional therapy tailored to your specific needs can provide a safe space to address the trauma.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight: Remember, healing is a process, and it takes time. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way. Remember that seeking help is a strength, not a weakness. If you need additional support, don't hesitate to ask for it. With time and practice, you can learn to cope with your PTSD and lead a fulfilling life.\n\nRemember, healing is a journey, and you're not alone. Take care of yourself and trust in the resilience that lies within you.",

The problem is that almost every second of everyday, I feel like if I tell the entire truth in any kind of situation something bad will happen, or I will be in trouble. I’ve never had any betrayals in my past that would leave an imprint on who I am, or ever felt unsafe telling the truth at home or at school. I’;m too ashamed to share this in the real world so I work very hard to keep track of my lies and keep them going so I’m never caught. It’s usually very small things, like in a story – time of day, exact setting, or who was there. I dont ever consciously do it with a goal in mind, and it doesn’t often change how someone would view or think of me. Rarely do they make my life easier, more often than not harder. I’m scared I’m going to ruin my life or relationships, and wanted any possible suggestions at improving myself or finding the root of this problem?",

            "Wow. You are dealing with a lot! You told me that you have been officially diagnosed, but you didn’t mention if you are getting any kind of treatment. I certainly hope so.Having Type 1 diabetes itself is a lot to handle on your own. It means a lifetime of self-monitoring and self-discipline that most people don’t have to deal with. I hope your endocrinologist or local hospital has a support group for young people to help young people like you find ways to manage the disease so that it doesn’t influence every part of your life. If you can’t find such a group, think about asking your doctor to start one. I’m not talking about a group to just learn more about the practical aspects of self-management. I’m hoping you can find a group that also encourages the teens involved to talk about their feelings and how they are navigating being different from kids who don’t have to test and adjust all day.You should also be getting some talk therapy to help you deal with the depression, anxiety and ADD. Medicine alone usually isn’t enough. I suspect your habit of lying a little in almost every situation is some kind of coping behavior for you. Without knowing more about you, I can’t go into depth here. But a licensed mental health counselor can help you figure out how the white lies somehow help you. I do suspect it has something to do with needing to feel in control of at least something about your life. But maybe not.I also want you to know that ADD isn’t a sentence. You can learn ways to work around it. Some of the most successful young adults I know have ADD and have found ways to use it to their advantage. Yes, they need to keep lists and calendars to make sure they don’t forget to do something important. But they tell me that what others see as “distractibility” is, for them, a gift. They tell me that thinking of many things at once helps them multi-task. What looks like not paying attention is really that they are paying attention to too much at once. They have had to learn how to sort among all the things they think and see to find what to focus on.  A therapist can also be your coach is making ADD work for you.I wish you well. "

        "question": "Hello. I developed a crush on a celebrity when I was 10 and it has grown into an obsession that I can’t stop (I’m 23 now). I’ve been diagnosed with generalised anxiety and have had depression in the past linked to poor self-image/esteem. My family relationships are good. I’ve had two relationships, one when 13 and the second when 15. The first time I was used by him and for 3 years until I got over him, whenever he was dating someone I would try hard to look like them (hair/makeup/clothes etc.). The second was emotionally abusive but I broke-up after a month and never wanted to reconcile. I thought about this celebrity less while in relationships but never fully stopped. Since my teen years I’ve fantasised about them: being in a relationship, conversing with them, being intimate (sexually) etc. When in a relationship with another female celebrity I became obsessed with her and still am, saving hundreds of pictures of her, watching all the interviews I could because I wanted to act, sound and look like her, eat, exercise and use the same beauty products as her if I could find that information. Whenever seeing pictures of them I feel a painful pit in my stomach. I would follow pages on instagram that followed them. After they broke up I stayed obsessed, less than initially but still, focusing more on whoever he’s currently with/dating (he’s with a regular girl now). I’ve tried to pursue his interests (e.g. art and watch the same TV shows) and also more recently tried to even use the same products and dress the same way he does if I can find that info (But I don’t want to be a man). I’m seeing a clinical psych and she said she’s unsure and to just avoid checking their social media (tried many times and even after over a month of abstaining from all social media it never worked). I’ve tried journaling, meditating, talking to friends and some things help a little but not much. I can barely differentiate what I like and what him/his girlfriends like. I can’t concentrate for a few minutes without them popping in my head even when I don’t want them to. Avoiding doesn’t help and I don’t want to, nor replace it by forcing myself in a relationship. I want to confront it so I never have the issue again.",

            "Though they are few in number, there are studies about celebrity worship. Those who have studied the phenomenon observe that celebrity worship exists on a continuum. At one end, celebrity worship is akin to being a passionate fan. A fan is an individual who is enthusiastically devoted to the support of something or someone.At the other end of the spectrum are individuals whose celebrity worship is considered unhealthy and problematic for their lives. This type of worship involves expressing excessive empathy with a celebrity’s successes and failures and obsessively tracking the details of their lives. In extreme cases, pathological worshipers progress into stalking or other types of dangerous behaviors.Celebrities and other public figures are at a greater risk for violence than they have been historically. This is especially true for celebrity athletes. The advent of the internet, especially social media, has made it easier for fans to interact with celebrities in a manner that was not available previously. Social media may cause some fans to believe they have a more personal relationship with a celebrity than they do in actuality. Social media also has the potential to magnify the intensity of a fan’s feelings and fantasies toward the celebrity.Studies have indicated that individuals who engage in celebrity worship display the following personality characteristics: sensation-seeking, cognitive rigidity, identity diffusion, poor internal boundaries, and narcissism. Individuals who demonstrated medium and high levels of celebrity worship were prone to fantasies and disassociation.Being prone to fantasies means that an individual regularly engages in the cognitive activity of imagining situations, ideas or stories that are impossible or improbable.Disassociation involves feeling detached from one’s physical and or emotional surroundings or one’s own identity. It is commonly associated with individuals with a history of traumatic experiences. It is considered an unconscious coping mechanism that evolves in response to painful experiences. In short, disassociation is a psychological mechanism that temporarily numbs unpleasant emotions.When you think about it, it makes sense that being prone to fantasies and experiencing disassociation are correlated. An individual who is prone to imagining improbable events, and thus caught up in their imagination, may struggle to feel connected to their surroundings.Studies also suggest that individuals who engaged in celebrity worship often had sexual thoughts and feelings about their favorite celebrity, were more apt to struggle with addiction, had tendencies toward engaging in criminal behavior, including stalking, and were prone to compulsive buying. They also had higher levels of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, social dysfunction, and reported lower levels of overall life satisfaction.The aforementioned research is not to suggest that you have any or all of these traits or symptoms. Thus far, the research in this area is limited and more work is necessary to determine what underlies celebrity worship.You mentioned that you began worshiping your particular celebrity of interest at the age of 10. It remains with you 13 years later, though to a lesser degree. It could be that this is a behavior that you have grown accustomed to and or it provides some level of comfort in times of stress.You’ve tried to stop but are struggling. Part of the problem may be that you are unwilling to stop. There is a difference between being unable to stop and being unwilling to stop. You seem to be indulging your obsession. Think about it. You are purposefully tracking your favorite celebrity and their love interests. If you didn’t search for that information, it is unlikely that you would know about it. It is a choice that you are making. The good news is that you can make a different choice.You’re in counseling and that is a good but you may need a different therapist. The two of you seem to be focused on the celebrity worship as opposed to the underlying motivation that is driving your behavior. A different focus may help. If no progress is being made, then a different therapist should be considered.It’s good that you are open to treatment. It significantly increases your probability of success. It may be that you simply haven’t found the right help. If you’d like to explore other options, contact three or four therapists over the phone and talk to them about this issue. Choose the one you like the best and meet with them in person. Choose the one with whom you feel the most comfortable. That person will likely be your best choice. Thanks for writing.

        "question": "I come from a broken home. My mother was a serial adulterer with various major mental issues, and my father is a bitter man. My younger sister has some major issues as well and is abusive to both me and my father. Despite this, he seems to prefer her more. He is a pretty unemotional man by nature, but he is always talking with her and they have a lot of fun. He mentors her gently and speaks very kindly to her. She’s very mean to him, telling him to go and kill himself and has physically attacked both of us in the past, but he still adores her. I’ve always tried to be a good kid and played mediator between my parents when they were divorcing. I’ve gotten good grades, helped around the house, and even got accepted into a top university with a generous grant. I’m not saying that that warrants affection, but my dad can’t stand to be around me. He’s always very critical and controlling of me, to the point where I’ve begun to develop an eating disorder. He never sees my accomplishments as accomplishments and instead tears down what I’ve done. He’s always pushing me away in favor of someone else. There are times when he’d rather be with his work buddies than with me. I try to joke with him, make him smile, make him things, and generally be the best daughter I can be, but I feel as if he just feels obligated to be around me because he’s my father, not because he loves me. I feel this is because I look very much like his ex-wife, my mother. Or maybe it’s for some other reason, I really don’t know. All I’ve ever really wanted in life is for him to have some pride in me. My father is someone I look up to a lot and who I love more than anything. I would do anything for him. My family is very small. All we have is each other. I truly love both my sister and my father despite how they act, but I would like to feel that same love. I just want to know what I can do to make him love me the same way he loves my younger sister.

Are there adult children, whose parents have died and who have never heard the words I love you from their parents?Your father may actually prefer you and love you more but shows your sister more outward affection because he feels she needs that to function. He may be much harder on you because you are the more successful child, and he may feel that he is simply pushing you towards greater development and success.We don’t know the answers to any of the questions that I have written above. We simply don’t know and we should not presume to know. He may simply give her more attention because she is already troubled and he is trying to make things better for her. Though we cannot know with certainty why he behaves the way he does, the previous explanation that I have suggested is likely close to the truth. I say that because it is often the case.Does he show you love in other ways? Could you make a list of all the ways your father has shown you love or in other words how many nice things he’s done for you, or how many personal sacrifices he’s made for you? You’re young and there is likely a lot of time left in the development of your relationship with your father. Perhaps, the answers that you seek will simply come to you over time. Perhaps your relationship with your sister will improve as she matures.Let’s take the worst-case scenario, which is very unlikely to be the case, your father and your sister do not love you. Can you survive without their love? Can you flourish without their love? The answer is yes in both cases. You could flourish under those circumstances and many, many people have done exactly the same thing. We must all overcome the circumstances of our lives. We are all born with certain advantages and disadvantages. It is your job in life, to overcome the disadvantages that you were born with or have encountered over time. The vast majority of persons must overcome their own disadvantages.If it proves to be true that neither your sister or father loves you, that is a disadvantage that you must simply overcome and you will. Right now, it appears that you are suggesting that they love less than you would like. You would like to be treated better and you would hope that they would display more affection towards you — and that is a reasonable thing. Perhaps things will improve with the passage of time and with further growth in your relationship with the both of them but perhaps not.At some point in your life, it will be the love of your spouse or the love of your children or the love of respected friends that will come to matter the most to you. It’s okay to complain about the bad things in life, but it is much more important to always realize and never take for granted the blessings in your life.Good luck, now and always.

Fool me twice, shame on me.” The point is that your family has taught him that he can do as he pleases with no negative consequences for inappropriate behavior. You didn’t give me enough information for me to make a guess why this got going. People can enable others out of fear, out of pity, because they feel they owe someone something, because they don’t know what else to do. Sometimes people enable someone in the hopes that if he gets enough support, he will straighten out. It rarely works but you can’t fault good hearted people from trying.Sometimes parents and older siblings at first enable a younger sibling because he’s cute or because they feel sorry he can’t keep up. What starts with the best of the intentions becomes a nightmare as the kid gets older and still expects everyone to see him as the Little Prince he once was.Perhaps you have an idea why your brother’s behavior is tolerated. If whatever started it still exists, chances are your parents won’t change their acceptance of his rude and entitled behavior. But that ‘s your parents’ decision.You are 26 — an adult. You probably can’t change your family’s way of operating since (judging from your father’s comment) they don’t want to change — even though they complain about him. You can change your response. Better yet, you can work, save your money, and set a goal for leaving them all to sort it out together like your sister did.  You don’t have to be a part of it.Meanwhile, stop cleaning his room (even if you are paid). Stop putting away his laundry. Put shades on your french doors so light won’t bother you. Don’t respond when he comes to you for something he wants. Let him know that he’s an adult and you will treat him like one even if no one else does. Then do it.If your parents would like to change your brother’s treatment of the family, I suggest you all go together to see a family therapist. The therapist will make it clear that you all can’t change him. But you can change how you all respond to him. The therapist will give you guidance and support for doing so.

            "Hopefully, you have stopped smoking marijuana. Marijuana is much more potent than it used to be. In the early 1990s, for instance, the average THC content was approximately 3.7%. A recent analysis of marijuana being sold in Colorado determined that the average THC content was 18.7%. The same might be true elsewhere. One expert featured in the Washington Post even noted that “underage kids have unbelievable access to nuclear-strength weed.” Because of this, there’s been a notable increase in the number of calls to poison control centers and visits to emergency rooms.The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) survey report indicates that in 2018, approximately 11% of eighth graders and 36% of 12th graders had used marijuana. About 6% of those 12th graders reportedly smoked marijuana on a daily basis making it the most widely used illicit drug in the 44-year history of the survey.Many teens consider marijuana safe or less risky than alcohol or other types of drugs. It’s a perception not based on fact. Higher potency levels make it more dangerous for adolescents. Though it can be useful in the treatment of some conditions involving pain, and others such as glaucoma, there are hazards in its use.Developmental issues are also a factor. Studies show that the brains of teenagers are not fully developed until about the age of 25. Using mind-altering drugs when the brain is already in a vulnerable state is risky. Studies thus far indicate that it negatively effects executive function, memory, attention span, concentration, and IQ levels. Generally speaking, it is a drug that should be avoided by adolescents.Psychologically healthy people don’t feel the need to use mind-altering substances. In order to protect one’s psychological health, it would be best to avoid all mind-altering substances.Your situation is not unlike that of many teenagers. I receive many letters from people describing the same type of situation you have described. They too are struggling with the aftereffects of marijuana use. People often underestimate how their using drugs will negatively affect their psychological health.It sounds as though you have anxiety. Anxiety is highly treatable with medication and psychotherapy. It seems to be the source of your problems. If you’re willing to consult a mental health professional, they can help you. It would be very wise to do so.Understandably, you might be worried about getting into trouble if you were to admit to a mental health professional that you used drugs but you don’t have to worry about that. They might advise you to avoid using drugs but they’re not going to turn you into the police or tell your parents. They will be focused on your health, well-being and finding a solution to your anxiety.To assess your symptoms, they will be collecting information. This includes things such as: how your symptoms manifest, how long you have been experiencing them, how you react to them, and related questions. The goal of collecting data is to understand the nature of this problem. It will assist them in determining a diagnosis. Treatment recommendations will likely include either medication and or psychotherapy. Once you begin treatment, your anxiety should dissipate. You should begin to feel better and more relaxed.In the meantime, try to resist the urge to research the disorders that you fear having. It will likely only increase your anxiety levels. Giving in to anxiety often causes it to increase. You don’t want to make it worse if you can help it. Try to stay grounded in reality. That can be difficult, especially with heightened levels of anxiety, which is why you should seek professional assistance. They can help you. They will know what to do because they treat cases like this all of the time. Hopefully, you will take this advice and consult a mental health professional. Good luck and please take care."

It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and recovery is possible. I understand that you've been living with this for quite some time, which can be really distressing.\n\nIdentify Key Thought or Belief:\nOne key thought that might contribute to your anxiety could be the belief that your past choices define who you are or that you're helpless to change your anxiety. You might also feel like your anxiety is a punishment for using marijuana.\n\nPose Challenge or Reflection:\nCan you tell me more about how you're currently experiencing your anxiety?

You have the power to work on managing it with therapy and self-care. One strategy could be to practice deep breathing exercises or relaxation techniques when you start feeling anxious. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help you identify and challenge these negative thoughts. Additionally, seeking professional help, such as a therapist experienced in anxiety treatment, can provide you with specific coping tools and strategies.\n\nEncouragement and Foresight:\nRemember that change takes time and progress is not always linear.

        "question": "I have very low self-esteem. Every therapist I have seen in my life has made a point of telling me I am homely and unattractive, whether I brought up the subject of my looks or not. In a group they were intent on assuring another patient how pretty she was, but at the same time putting me down. We both had short hair and no makeup. Other therapists have put me down as unfixable unattractive, even when I had long hair, makeup, and a basically fit body. Male and female therapists alike expressed this opinion, even when they liked me as a person and enjoyed working with me. I know I’m not a supermodel, but I think I’m pretty enough for people in general. Why would providers tear down a vulnerable patient like this? (From of USA)",

            "There are several elements of your question that I think are very interesting and important to explore. I’d like to focus on three of them.The first is the fact that you’ve written to us about this issue. It demonstrates bravery, honesty, and humility in taking what sounds like a long-standing issue and putting it front and center. Since the issue is self-esteem you’ve begun with the most important feature, which is learning to speak up and having a voice about your needs. Bravo!Our very own Marie Hartwell-Walker has written an excellent book on self-esteem that can be very helpful in continuing to develop your strength and voice. You can learn more about the book here and here.The second of your concerns has to do with the fact that there is universality among different therapists at different times, in different formats, across gender. You identify the phenomenon as life-long, in group and individual psychotherapy, with every male and female therapist, and coming at you unsolicited. This is important because it means that no matter where you look in the therapeutic community there is one recurring theme happening — they are all pointing out how unattractive and homely you are.Whenever there is a universal theme that pops up in therapy, particularly when the matter is life-long and with multiple activators, the first question to entertain is what could be causing this? If someone told me everywhere they are looking the world seems colored in an orange tint — the first thing I’d look to see is if they are wearing orange-colored glasses.To test this out you’d want to ask yourself two questions. First, did this type of put-down occur in your family of origin or in other significant relationships? If it has, then this becomes a very fertile ground to explore because it means that there have been other incidents where the people who should have loved you treated you poorly. If this is the case, the therapeutic environment is where it is happening again. This changes the understanding of the phenomenon because it is a recurrence — not a first-time happening.The second question you’ll want to ask is if there is any incidence where this wasn’t happening in therapy. Look for the differential. See if there were times when this wasn’t happening, or people that it didn’t happen with that could be explored. Understanding where it doesn’t occur is as important as understanding where it does.Finally, I would highly recommend that whatever the results of your thinking on this topic produce that you bring it back into therapy. Tell the therapist immediately when you feel it has happened. This gives both empowerment to you, and insight for the therapist to work with in making a change that can be helpful.Wishing you patience and peace, "

        "cbt_answer": "I understand how you're feeling, and it's really disheartening to have had such experiences in therapy. It can be challenging to navigate when your self-esteem is already low and professionals in the field contribute to that negative self-image. Let's examine these thoughts and beliefs using CBT:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy: I appreciate your efforts to understand the situation and share your feelings. It's important to acknowledge that you've been subjected to unhelpful feedback. It's natural to feel hurt and vulnerable when someone you trust criticizes your appearance.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief: The core belief here seems to be that therapists, regardless of their gender, consistently criticize your appearance and view it as a fundamental flaw. This belief might lead to the assumption that all therapists are incompatible with improving self-esteem or that you are unworthy of positive feedback.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection: It's crucial to question this belief. Are there specific instances or patterns that support this idea, or might there be individual differences in their approach? Remember, everyone has their own perspective and style, and not all therapists express themselves in the same way. It's also worth considering that therapists are trained to provide professional feedback, not to tear you down.\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight: It might be helpful to set boundaries and communicate your preferences upfront. Let your therapist know that you'd appreciate constructive feedback on issues other than your appearance. If you continue to feel uncomfortable, consider seeking a therapist who values a non-judgmental approach and focuses on building self-esteem in a supportive way.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight: Remember that one negative experience doesn't define your worth or the quality of potential therapists. Keep an open mind, and don't be afraid to seek a different perspective. With time and effort, you can work on building your self-esteem without letting past experiences hold you back.\n\nRemember, self-esteem is a journey, and it's essential to have supportive and validating relationships along the way. If you ever feel ready, consider joining a support group or seeking therapy specifically focused on building self-esteem, where you'll likely find more understanding and encouragement.",

            "Thank you for writing. I’m sure you understand why he’s upset. From his point of view, your personal troubles have suddenly caused a major change in your relationship. He thought he was involved with a partner who is sexually attracted to him and who is excited to share sexual intimacy. It’s a reflection of his love for you and his attempt to be understanding that he hasn’t left you over this sudden change in your partnership.You are absolutely right that the difference in your sexual desire is putting pressure on your relationship. The scoliosis has always been there so something else has caused the change in you.I have to wonder if your depression and the drugs you are taking are what is making you “okay” with a low libido. SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) that are commonly used for depression often cause a drop in sex drive. In fact, some studies have shown that as many as 50% of users of SSRIs suffer a major drop in their libido. I hope you will talk to your prescriber about whether some changes can be made in your medication (either the medication or the dosage or even the timing of when you take it) so you can reclaim that part of yourself.A low sex drive is treatable. But you need to find a qualified couples therapist to work with. Ask your doctor for a referral to a local licensed couples therapist who works well with sexual and intimacy problems. The therapist will help you address your self-esteem problems and will help your partner learn ways to support you as you deal with them. A couples therapist can also provide a safe place to look at whether there is an underlying problem that has caused the two of you to be engaged for 4 years instead of marrying. It could be that the sexual problems are an outcome of something amiss in your relationship that the two of you either haven’t identified or have been too scared to address directly.A crisis in a relationship can destroy it or be an important point of self-discovery and growth. You and your fiance have been together for four years. I hope you will give therapy a chance before you throw away a relationship that has been meaningful to you both until a year ago.I wish you well."

But it’s just not true that every man who fathers a child is fit to be a dad. Your partner hasn’t committed himself to you by marrying you. He hasn’t manned up as a father since his son was born.

        "question": "Basically, I was extremely happy with my boyfriend for months and then we went on a holiday. On this holiday, I met his cousin and my boyfriend and I supported him at the time as he was going through friend issues. Consequently, my boyfriend became closer with him and so did I – to the point where we started introducing him to our friends that my boyfriend and I mutually share and are very close to. A few months later and the cousin has really been disrespectful towards me – he has been rude etc. Or thinking he can talk to me or treat me a certain way. To the point where it has caused me mass anxiety. Now, my boyfriend feels in the middle and I just want things to go back to the way they were before the holiday where he wasn’t involved so much in my life (I see him every weekend through the friends I’m close to). My boyfriend does not have it in his nature to cause conflict and therefore leaves the conflict and has not stood up for me. I have reached a point where I feel as if I cannot be with him unless he supports me and stands up for me. For example today he was at a braai and it was obvious I was clearly uncomfortable about him and I’ve made my boyfriend aware of this – yet he would laugh with him and make jokes with him while I didn’t want to talk to him. This is my boyfriends first relationship. Also, he is very emotionally manipulated – he gets scared of this cousin if he makes plans that the cousin isn’t invited to (like will he freak out scared) . I just want him out of my friend group and to see him as little as possible like a family member and not a close friend. I want to hope that maybe , he will even cut ties as much as he could with this person after seeing how badly he has treated me. I just want my number one person to understand that family shouldn’t be this involved in your friend group etc. And I want to feel like he’s in my corner.

            "To use a phrase, your boyfriend doesn’t like confrontation. That essentially means that some people are willing to tolerate abuse or unfair treatment to avoid upsetting a situation or appearing as though they are “causing trouble.” Because they don’t want to hurt someone’s feelings, they inadvertently allow others to take advantage of them, to tell them what to do or to boss them around. The end result is that they are often considered easy targets for people who like to dominate others. It may be his personality type or he may be inexperienced at handling aggressive or dominant people. As you mentioned, he’s only 19 and may not have much experience dealing with people in general.If this is his personality style, then you can expect that he will behave this way in most or all circumstances of this nature. You rightfully want him to protect you from his disrespecting cousin, but in all likelihood that is not going to happen. Personality-wise, he may not be comfortable with the idea of appearing to “cause trouble.” Expecting him to change is unrealistic.Your boyfriend might fit the category of a people pleaser. These individuals often find themselves catering to everyone else’s happiness, often at the expense of their own happiness. They worry and care about how others view them. Their core motivation is getting the approval of others. Once they gain the approval they seek, it helps them feel good about themselves but that feeling is temporary. Unfortunately, this behavior comes at the expense of their own happiness. They are in essence sacrificing themselves, their own wants and needs, for people who do not and will not reciprocate. People pleasers often feel a great deal of resentment towards the people who take advantage of them. What they might not realize is that the unfair treatment is often their own fault for allowing others to take advantage of them. It was of their own self-doing.Another possibility is that your boyfriend is fond of his cousin and wants him around. He may even prefer his cousin over you. Though possible, it’s more probable that he is simply frightened of confronting his cousin. However, all possibilities have to be considered.Dating is a process of getting to know each other. As you learn more about each other, and experience many situations, you will get a sense of what your partner is like. If you see something problematic, then that may be a sign that this person is not a good match for you. You may be more oriented towards partners who will defend you and not allow others to abuse you. This relationship may not be for you.If you decide to end the relationship, don’t consider it a failure. You will have learned something important about yourself which is that you prefer a partner who does not tolerate your unfair treatment. That information will assist you in choosing your next partner. You might also consider consulting a therapist. It could help you to choose a better match in the future, should this relationship end. Good luck with your efforts. Please take care."

Explain your feelings, the impact on your relationship, and how you would appreciate his support. Give him space to understand your perspective and work together to find a solution that works for both of you.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, change takes time, and it's possible that your boyfriend may need some guidance on how to navigate the situation. It's okay to set boundaries and ask for his help in doing so. If the cousin's behavior persists, encourage your boyfriend to prioritize his loyalty to you and your friendship. It's also advisable to address any underlying emotional manipulation to prevent it from affecting your relationship in the long run.\n\nI hope these suggestions help.

I think it is a reflection of your sensitivity. You are not alone in your struggles with being privileged. Many teens and young adults who are so fortunate to be wealthy feel conflicted about it. They know they haven’t done anything themselves to earn it. Often they wonder if they could have gained the same comfort if they had had to do it on their own. Doubt about their own abilities and the awareness that others haven’t been as lucky results in what looks very much like a self-esteem problem.Having as much as you do when so many other people in the world don’t have enough is a burden as well as a gift. It calls on you to figure out what you can do to feel that you are using your wealth to be helpful to others.Yes, there are wealthy people who never seem to have enough to feel good. They try to fill a hole in their self-regard by having multiple homes, big cars and fancy clothes and fancier parties. But it’s not a strategy that works. They only continue to feel empty. So they continue to accumulate more money and more material things. It never seems to be enough.People with wealth who feel good about themselves are those who put a substantial part of it into doing good in the world. Often it starts out modestly with volunteering at someplace that serves others less fortunate. As people find a cause that touches their heart, they put more of their time and money into it. Doing good is what makes people feel good. It’s that simple.I don’t think you need a psychologist — though a therapist might give you some needed encouragement.I do think you need to find a  more supportive boyfriend. Your guy is too concerned with appearances. A quality guy would be much more interested in your values and your empathy. Take a step back from this relationship and make yourself available so you can find someone with better values. You deserve it.I also think you need to take some steps to make yourself feel like you are doing something worthwhile with your good fortune. Choose something that really touches your heart.

It's important to acknowledge your feelings without harshly judging yourself. Here, I'll help you identify key thoughts and provide strategies to cope.\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nYour feelings of self-consciousness and fear of comparison are common, especially in situations where external measures of wealth seem to dominate. It's understandable that these emotions can affect your self-esteem. It's okay to feel this way, and it takes courage to acknowledge them.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nOne key belief could be: \"I must have a certain level of wealth to be accepted or worthy.\" Another might be: \"It's not enough that I have a good education and a comfortable life; others' possessions define my value.\"\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\n Frage: Are there specific events or interactions that trigger these feelings, or is it a general feeling about societal expectations? \n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nInstead of pretending to be someone else, try focusing on your own strengths and achievements. Remember that wealth doesn't solely determine worth. You can work on a growth mindset, accepting that your worth comes from who you are, not what you own. Regularly remind yourself of your unique qualities and accomplishments.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nIt might take time to overcome these thoughts, so be patient with yourself. Make a list of your positive qualities and achievements, and practice reflecting on them when you start feeling down. If necessary, consider speaking to a trusted adult or a professional counselor to help you process your feelings and develop coping mechanisms.\n\nRemember, changing these beliefs and managing self-esteem takes time and effort. Keep working on it, and know that you're not alone in this journey.",

        "question": "I am 15 and I feel like I might have some signs of being a psychopath. I tell lies every day, either to get attention or to get out of trouble and I feel no guilt about it. I can turn my charm on and off to get what I want, and I can be very good at getting people to do what I want. I feel some empathy like I feel sorry for people, but I have very little time for other people’s problems and emotions. I don’t like hurting people and I don’t do it, however, I feel very little guilt about hurting people’s feelings. When people try to tell me their problems I get bored easily and even annoyed. I like having power over people and I also feel like I can act very childish at times. I know I’m not a full-blown psychopath, but I feel like I show some signs and I need to know what to do.

            "I wouldn’t be too quick to self-diagnose, but I am very glad that you are reflecting on your behavior and are concerned about your lack of empathy for others. The fact that you feel sorry for others, and also do not like to hurt people is a good thing because that immediately takes you out of the running for being a psychopath. The fact that these concerns are there, even though you override them and can hurt people without feeling much guilt, means that, by definition, you aren’t psychopathic.While I am not here to offer a diagnosis or label, I think the fact that this set of symptoms troubles you is a very good sign. Psychopaths are actually identified by the mental health professionals as people who have antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and often have disregard for the safety of themselves or others and are consistently irresponsible. While your style of deceit and lack of remorse isn’t psychopathic, it is of concern because it has some of the features characterized by individuals with ASPD.This doesn’t mean these concerns shouldn’t be addressed. While they might not meet the criteria for ASPD nor what might be called a psychopath, they can lead to many problems socially and legally down the road. Because you list your age as 15 there are a number of other factors that may influence your behavior and your thinking. Learning about what it is you can do now to change these reactions is all-important. Your age is in your favor as there are many ways to manage and correct these uncomfortable issues. Here is a list of treatment possibilities, which include psychotherapy and self-help.This brings me to my point, which is that it is time to get some help with this. You’ve done an excellent job by beginning this process and writing us here, and now it is time to ask your parents, or the people at your school for some counseling.You’ve taken a good first step. Now it is time to continue by asking for some help with this. Use the fact that this style of behavior and thinking bothers you to make changes that will not only help you feel better — it is likely to help keep you out of trouble later on. Your parents or the people at school will know who to put you in touch with to deal with these issues. I admire your bravery in tackling this head-on.Wishing you patience and peace, "

        "cbt_answer": "I understand that you're feeling concerned about these aspects of yourself, and it's important to remember that your emotions and behaviors can be complex and influenced by various factors at your age. Let's explore these feelings step by step, using the structure of CBT:\n\n1. Validation and Empathy:\nIt's normal to have questions and concerns, especially when you're going through a period of self-discovery. It's okay to feel a mix of things like charm and empathy, but it's crucial to acknowledge that these feelings might not align perfectly with societal expectations. You're still learning and growing, and many people might not have these exact characteristics at this age.\n\n2. Identify Key Thought or Belief:\nOne possible key thought or belief here might be that you're a psychopath or have psychopathic tendencies, but it's important to recognize that a single behavior or pattern doesn't define your entire personality. You might believe that your actions are justified by a lack of guilt or empathy, but this might be an distorted perception.\n\n3. Pose Challenge or Reflection:\nImagine if you were a therapist, how would you challenge this belief? Consider, for instance, that telling lies and manipulating others might be temporary behaviors or perhaps a coping mechanism. Have you thought about the root cause of these actions, or if they could be healthier ways to deal with your emotions?\n\n4. Provide Strategy or Insight:\nInstead of dwelling on being a psychopath, focus on understanding and addressing the underlying reasons for your behavior. You might want to practice empathy by reflecting on situations where you feel less empathetic and try to understand others' perspectives. Developing a more mature understanding and managing your emotions could help.\n\n5. Encouragement and Foresight:\nRemember, self-improvement is a continuous process. Don't be too hard on yourself, and seek support from family, friends, or a professional if needed. Consider talking to a counselor or a trusted adult about your concerns. They can provide guidance and help you develop coping strategies.\n\nRemember that you are young, and these behaviors can change as you grow and learn more about yourself. It's essential to keep learning and working on developing healthy emotional and interpersonal skills.",
